Background:
[[Vita Est]] is a collective of people who wish to achieve a new means of immortality. They tried to develop a way to achieve vampirism through alchemy instead of supernatural methods. They succeeded. Now, a vampire seeks to kill all of those involved.



Can you hear the sun?
Where did you go? Don't you want to live forever?
That's what they would have wanted.
You made this. YOU made this.






1) a. **The Moordock Manor** (*Can you hear the sun?*)
Ludmire Helsing is dead in his room. A man and a woman block the door from those trying to enter. The people do not rush in, not out of fear, but out of respect of the two's wishes, who are well known in the area. There is another man, [[Indris Hesshire]], nearby the door, asking for those who are looking for coin and are willing to solve a murder.
* If adventurers start a conflict with the two, the crowd will protect them and vice versa.
* Indris is willing to pay 100 gold to each person in the detective party.
* Ludmire died via poison in his room. Nearby is a used ampule, a pitcher of flat ale and a mug. His room's window is closed, but the lock is broken. No signs of struggle. In fact, there is a wound between his rib and spine. A festering cut where blackened veins originate and slowly retract. [Arcana/Medicine] A diseased blade (Vamp Rot).
* Indris has one lead: [[Abram Redfeather]]. Another friend and colleague of Indris and Ludmire. However, Ludmire and Abram had a severe altercation years ago. Abram was always had resentment and anger towards Ludmire since then. His lab is actually in Moordock.

Player Actions
* Players discovered Ludmire's body and Vampire Rot
* Players discovered [[Adster Merryweather]] and they are now tied up in basement
* Viper saw cloaked figure. Next time, maybe don't give freebies.

1) b. **The Moordock Manor**
After discovering the cause of Ludmire's death, our adventurers have found a man in the closet. Hoping to find the person responsible for Ludmire's demise, perhaps the answer lies tied in the Manor's brewery. 
* The man in the closet is [[Adster Merryweather]]. Adster is part of the Salty Breeze gang, a den of thieves and rapscalians. They're harmless small-fry as far as anyone's concerned, but they always talk big regardless.
* It might take a lot of convincing or a visit to The Salty Breeze's headquarters to get this info, but they got a job from [[Abram Redfeather]] to steal Ludmire's clothes while he was asleep. Adster was assigned to the task.
* The Redfeather Mansion nears the outskirts north of Moordock.

2) **Redfeather's Study**
The study is on the outskirts of Moordock. The first floor is guarded by three mechanical eagles. There is a pressure plate past the front doors which will wake the eagles. The Mansion is filled with trophies and taxidermy of animals of all kinds. There is an empty plaque which reads, "Ludmire Helsing".
* Abram Redfeather is a almond-skined half-elf with sharp features, including the distinctive elven ears. Any loose jet black hair is swept back and and tucked behind his ears so as not to cover the restless blood-orange eyes behind his half-circle glasses. Underneath his alchemist's coat is a wrinked dress shirt, half-tucked into his grey dress pants. He adorns a gold ring. His academy sigil.
* Ludmire usually comes in through the front door, where Abram's automaton Chaplin would disable the alarm after it triggers via a button by the lights. Today, he bugged Chaplin so that he would get stuck and not press the button.
* Ludmire was never supposed to die. [Secret] He was supposed to turn into a vampire. He had two ampules for himself and Juniper if she wanted it.
* [Secret] The suppressant ampules make you immune to vamp rot.
* [Secret] Abram is a false vampire. He is willing to kill everyone here. He is not willing to harm Juniper.
* [Perception 15] There is a panel on one of the walls that will reveal a hidden rotating section of wall in his lab. Abram knows how to open it, but wlll not allow players to see inside. It can be opened by force [Athletics DC 20]. Behind the rotating wall is a huge chamber filled with the bodies of dead vampires in coffins. One living vampire is flayed open, being siphoned of their blood, and locked to a table. Overhead is a panel connected to a lever. This panel opens to reveal the sky. The sun shines brightly onto the table and into the room.
* Redfeather, if unprovoked, will contact the Syndicate to see if they have any information on Ludmire's death. He recommends the players to rest and explore the town, a response will take a while. [[Moordock]]

Day 2
Chamber dreams of black smoke. But it's not smoke, it's soot. The sun tries to pierce the clouds surrounding him, but barely breaks through, like light through a church window. The stench of sulfur stains your nose, and the more you move through it, the more gets on you. The man who led the party that decimated your village walks towards you. If he shoots, the man explodes into a spray of gunpowder and incinerates, covering Chamber in flame. As the fire consumes him and when the powders ignite then dissipate, he sees a different person's body bleeding on the ground.

Juniper intends to go back home to bury her brother in the morning. The coffin is empty.

Back at Redfeather's, he is in his hidden laboratory, operating on Ludmire. After three rounds, Ludmire shoots upright and gasps.

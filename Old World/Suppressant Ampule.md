The Vita Aerosol or [[Suppressant Ampule]] was a line of work-in-progress aerosolized serums that afflicted the user with a lethal chronic illness that could only be delayed with continuous administration of the medicine. A new version of the Aerosol additionally grants the user with immunity to vamp rot. Anyone could transfuse themselves with vampire blood and they wouldn't die anymore but instead, turn into a vampire.

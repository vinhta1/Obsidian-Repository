Viper,
No need for gold this time: we have a request. One of our executives, **[[Ludmire Helsing]]**, has died. We've lost contact with the eyes and ears we had assigned to watch him as well. We know that his allies are asking for adventurers to investigate the body at the **Moordock Manor, located at Fireport**. His brute of a guard wouldn't let anyone he was paranoid of close, and he's been *very* paranoid as of late, so we suspect foulplay. **Your objective** is to identify Helsing's cause of death and to clean any evidence of our involvement with him and his death if you find it.

Attached is two doses of your suppressant and an express fare to Fireport. This mission's important. I'm sure you can put together what happens if you fail. Not my call.

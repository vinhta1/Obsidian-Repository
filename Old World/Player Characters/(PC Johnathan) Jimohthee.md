[[The Ragewilds]]

War mercenary, abandoned baby taught to be a merc by other mercenariess
Was hired by a noble [[Ludmire Helsing]] for a while, then the noble died.
Now hired by friends of Ludmire to investigate his death but more importantly, find the killer.

Jimohthee has been hired by Ludmire Helsing for a year now. But, Ludmire's become uncharacteristically paranoid these past few weeks and didn't let anyone near him. Except for one person. At dinner, he asked for privacy in public. Jimohthee couldn't identify the individual Ludmire sat down with, but it was a long talk. They both each went to their respective bedrooms. But before Ludmire closed his door, he thanked his bulkier broodier half. "Great things are coming. I'll make sure you're rewarded properly, Jimohthee." Ludmire didn't wake up the next morning. Since then, Jimohthee has been keeping Ludmire's friends busy since then, and he's even joined their investigation party, despite his less than satisfactory intelligence.

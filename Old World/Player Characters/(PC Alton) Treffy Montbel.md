Church killed wife
Dracula goes nuts
Church blames Trevor's family and kills them

Church of The Creeping Sun
Family is a line of monster hunters, primarily vampires and werewolves
They specifically hunted **only evil-intending monsters**
Uncle was a priest of the Creeping Sun
Treffy knows Uncle is bad and is the reason they died
Vampires killed parents, when it was his uncle who orchastrated the event.

The Montbel was exiled from the church for reasons Treffy doesn't know.

The night his parents died, three years ago. [[Jerome and Karen Montbel]]
Treffy was still training, not a fully fledged monster hunter yet.
Treffy's parents told him to hide at first.
Brought to a secret basement.
From the basement, Treffy heard the windows crash and his parents back away from the walls, and then shortly after a fight. He tried to stay quiet, but when he started to hear the screams of his mother, he rushed out of the basement to help. However, he and his family were defeated after a brief battle. During the last of his quickly fading conciousness, his vision blackened, he heard footsteps coming through the front door. "Search the basement. Leave the boy alive." It was uncle [[Jeri Nystachio]].

Treffy moved to Nyomi and has since been training for the past three years in the hopes of becoming strong enough to confront his uncle, getting by by stealing, fighting, and hiding.

He was at Moordock Manor by coincidence.

[[Remedium]]
A thief who lost his family ransacking an old mansion with dark secrets.

Criminal contact: [[Anton 'Ant' Greaves]]

[[Book of Names]]

Xavier's investigation records:
1) [[Lionell Suress]]
	Suress's letters to Indi displayed a thoughtful recital of past memories, regretful apologies of breaking promises of having dinner with her so many nights, and a sudden explanation that he had to go somewhere for a long time. He wrote he hoped to meet her once again someday, but until then, he bid farewell.
	Next to the letter was a shimmering green wax stick, hardened into a puddle of itself. Your eyes trail to the two wax stamps nearby. One was of his own crest that he used for his personal letters. After peeling the solidified wax off, you recognize the other was of unknown crest you found on him earlier. There are no signs of letters with that seal. Looking at the mess left behind, it seems that as important as Indi was, the other letters was more important.
	You gaze at the mess around you, the holes in the wall as if someone was trying to demolish it with a hammer. But they don't make fist-shaped indents on stone. Torn bags, books and clothes strewn about show signs of a preparation to leave and a ransacking. Broken glass and hanging fabric indicate that he was pushed through a window. Outside the window is a trail, that like of a man being dragged in the rain.
		Summary
		Suress was preparing to leave. Bags were packed.
		Dangerous creature or person arrived. Then, a struggle and then a ransacking.
		Letters stamped with the unfamiliar crest are missing. Likely sent before altercation.
		Someone was forcibly removed from his home. Probably Suress.
		Order of events unsure.
		Indi and Suress were close to eachother.
2) [[Yoland Porter]]
	Upon meeting the Porter siblings, they seemed ordinary. Despite Indi knowing Suress intimately, she had no clue where he could have gone reminiscing that, "he often has important business to attend to. He'd stay with me some nights and be gone the next. I'm sure wouldn't drop his work for a lady like me." You had a feeling that he really wanted to. (You can give Suress's letter to Indi if you want to.)
	Yoland was just as civilian as she was. He did attend the more tolerant churches of The Creeping Sun, where he was well acquainted with Suress through Indi. On that same note, he was acquainted with the Montbels through Suress. He figured if anyone was familiar with Suress, it was probably Jerome or Karen Montbel.
		Summary
		Indi and Yoland knew Suress personally. Yoland and Suress were mutual friends.
		Neither of them knew if Suress did anything deserving of a home invasion.
		Yoland pointed you to the Montbel residence.
		Despite knowing three people from the book, they weren't on it.
3) [[Ludmire Helsing]]
	*Much like the Montbel Residence before, Helsing's house was also destroyed in a fire. However, there were no signs of an attack. Once again, there is a hidden basement and within that basement, nothing but broken glass and ash. Amongst the soot and the charred dust, there is one glistening oversight. A metal pin bearing that same unknown crest.*
	A few weeks of travel later, you manage to find one Juniper Helsing in Farnhügel. However, she seems as mundane as the Porters were. You watch for a few days and notice she's hosting a Goliath called Chamber in their home. It isn't common to see a goliath, generally speaking, but it is rare to see one outside their own tribes or private dealings. During one conversation, you learn that she is going to meet her brother at Moordock, Ingyo. There's another Helsing named Ludmire? She says he's a scholar, doing research on Mortuian plant species. She hasn't seen him for years, but he sent a letter asking for her to meet him there. He sent that letter months ago, but scheduled it for two weeks from now, about the same time it takes for a boat to arrive from Farnhügel to Moordock. She's excited to see her brother, but is a bit saddened by the idea of possibly seeing another friend she's been estranged from. She says her brother and him had a fight that they were never able to recover from.
		Summary
		Whichever Helsing is being targeted, they are in the same league as Suress.
		The first Helsing residence is burned to the ground. Juniper did not speak of it.
		There are two Helsings, Juniper the sister and Ludmire the brother.
		You assume Ludmire as the person in the book.
		She and Chamber are heading to Moordock soon. It'd be easy to board the ship without detection, maybe even easier to steal a ticket.
		This trip has been planned for months.
		Ludmire works with plant life. Might have been a lie to not involve Juniper.

An alchemist collective that has developed a suppresant for a mysterious disease that has recently emerged. People with the disease have to pay the syndicate for the medicine, but quickly find themselves racked with debt. Most of these people don't live for much longer. But others who are fortunate enough to be useful to the syndicate find themselves in a one-sided agreement for their lives.

They do have some official capacity, with their headquarters established in [[Gearhead]], Mortui. Afterall, they're the forefront of biochemical research in the whole region, not to mention the ones leading the charge towards the cure for vampirsm and lycanthropy. Some call it blasphemy, others an affront to life, but the syndicate likes to refer to it as progress. However, besides the few public projects they have announced years prior, the rest are under the table. To the common person or even the lesser executives, the syndicate will make the quality of living better for everyone. To those in the know, they are far from that.

While most of The Alameda Syndicate are researchers, scientists, and arcane experts with more or less good intentions, it is the boardmembers and the high executives running the show. What nobody knows, is that they are the oldest vampires to have ever existed.

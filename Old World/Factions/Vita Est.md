Vita Est is a collective of nine high ranking people from their respective orders: Lionell Suress, Renvale Waters, Ludmire Helsing, and Abram Redfeather of the Alameda Syndicate; Jerome Montbel, Karen Montbel, Marcille Boquet, and Jeri Nystachio of The Church of the Creeping Sun; and lastly, Dutchess Syra Avora. Their main objective was to obtain immortality. Their method is vampirism. But not under any master: there will be no thralls. They wanted to find a way so anyone can become a vampire. They were successful. 

The Vita Aerosol or [[Suppressant Ampule]] was a line of work-in-progress aerosolized serums that afflicted the user with a lethal chronic illness that could only be delayed with continuous administration of the medicine. At least, that was the case until a week ago. The illness could not be removed from the serum, but at least now, it granted the user immunity to vamp rot. Anyone could transfuse themselves with vampire blood and they wouldn't die anymore. Instead they would live forever as a newly reborn vampire.

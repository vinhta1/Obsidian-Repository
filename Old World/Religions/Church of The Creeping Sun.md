Worships [[Daymore, The Creeping Sun]]
Anti undead, domain of life religion

The undead should not exist. Just because they are in this plane and are common occurance, doesn't mean that they have the right to be. But with time, shifting perspectives, and an alternative way for vampires to sustain themselves, not many people align themselves with the church anymore. Furthermore, those who still do are split between whether or not the new generation of vampires are evil at all. In some sectors of the church, the ability to discern good from evil is vital. In others, the dead must stay dead.

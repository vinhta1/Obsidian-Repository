The Slick Barrel
* A sort of pawn shop located within Dockside where most things foreign, exotic, or mundane can be found. Not so much a general store, but if it previously belonged to someone, it might be found here.
* Owned and ran by Thorneside, a tortile in paladin's gear. In his later years, his adventuring phase is over.

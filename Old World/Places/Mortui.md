**Setting**
	*The Mortuitano (People)*
		Generally, the Mortuitano (people of Mortui) consists of mainly vampires and lycanthropes. While the people are divided into two groups, werewolves and vampires aren't enemies. In fact, there is disagreement among the populace over a cure for vampirism or lycanthropy.
		&nbsp;
		While about a third of werewolves and the majority of vampires support the cure and aceepted it, the rest of the region believe it goes against their nature as people, that the cure removes them of their freedoms as vampires and werewolves like amputating a leg, and that they need not be cured at all. Because of this, the vampire and lycan Mortuitano has split into two groups: those who accept the cure and those who deny it.

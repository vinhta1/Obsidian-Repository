Just like in the handbook, but they don't need invitations to enter homes.

**Vampire Rot**
When a vampire drinks blood, they change the natural makeup of their own blood so they can accept the new blood. This allows them to transfuse it back into their victim, turning others into thralls or even true vampires. However, without this process, vampire blood is lethal to living beings. 

Hemolytic transfusion reaction occurs when blood types incompatible with eachother meet. The host creates antibodies which will attack the transfused blood, causing them to burst. Similarly, due to its magical nature when vampire blood meets nonmagical blood, it attacks and overwhelms it.

Specifically, it coagulates the blood and darkens it, making it a globulous black ooze. The veins surrounding the entry zone blacken and slowly retract. The zone quickly festers and develops a pus-covered crust. Hence the title, "Vampire Rot". Of course, why would such a prideful creature bleed to kill something when they can just use their hands.

# What Does Icarus See or Want?
Murder vacation for Icarus. He's OP AS HELL, in Hell as well!
Souls of the damned, demons.
He doesn't see any of old Chinatown
He does, however, see the old archangels, if more than just one

# What Does Jerri See or Want?
For Jerri, something she could want/ need to see are previous users- when Lucifer takes control of you and your soul, where do you go? Is hell accessible physically or only spiritually (can Jerri only connect to hell through her soul)?
Ummm
I feel like there’s more I can ask here but I gotta figure out what
Can you visit hell? Can you visit hell with others? (These questions relate to how one accesses hell)
Are Lucifer’s power from hell, or is hell from Lucifer?
If hell is a place, is heaven a place? Is there a required balance between the two?
In close relation to this, if Lucifer stops existing will hell stop existing or the other way around?
Honestly, I feel like “hell of your own making” as an idea could be really interesting, like in hell you’re haunted by your past/fears etc
But there’s a lot of creative directions hell can go

# What Does Reggie See or Want?
He wants to expand his influence. If he can't be God, he'll settle with Satan.
There's a distinction between Lucifer and Satan. One is a name, the other is a title.
He doesn't care about ruling Hell, so much as he does ruling his inhabitants. Thus, he seeks to cause Hell on Earth.
Power over all Sinners. Father of all sinners.

# What Does Nero See or Want?
Nero wants to close the rifts related to Hell, because of its self-propagating nature.
Sinners cause more sinners. She doesn't know what "sin" is anymore.
Life is simpler when you are asleep. Life is simpler when you focus on "what is" and not on "what can be."

# The Mechanics of Hell
## Keys to The Kingdom
Black Rock Sulfur Key can get into and out of portals. Collect more to gain hell powers. Grantable to others (like the feathers). Collect them all to create the devil's diadem. Maybe each one defended by an Archangel?

## Day Night Cycle
Not so much a day and night, so much as it is a blink of blinding and a blink of darkness. Every move threatens to change from day to night and vice versa. Don't move during the day. Move during the night. See enemies during the day. Lose them during the night.
### The Red Suns
A light that burns all impurities. Distilling from every being, sin and spirit from flesh. The land takes their remains, not physical, but spiritual, and turns them into demons.
Staying in the light will HURT. Hit a status-6 and turn into a demon.
### Flaming Sulfur
The fire itself is barely visible in light. It can be noticed wherever there is smoke. However, in the dark, you can see a luscious blue flame that covers the ground like an ocean. This fire burns and slows you down.
Use smoke and darkness to watch your step.

## Demons and Devils
There are no Devils. Not yet.
Demons are people fully burned away. They exist only to torment and to hurt people not fully turned. They like to drag people into the light. Basically zombies.
# The Hierarchy of Hell
There is no Satan. Chaos is the rule of the land. Most people try to escape, until they warp, and then they hunt others.
The land itself is evil. It turns people into demons. It warps their mind. It twists their being.
Archangels are exempt from turning
Nero (fakes) are not.

Is Nero even in hell? The fake Neros would be in New Chinatown wouldn't they?

# What Does Hell Look Like

Crystalline Yellow, Soot and Ash Fields and Paths
A Realm on Fire, Burning Blue, Smoking Grey
Red Suns Like Eyes, Watching, Smiling? Tormenting All
Pockets of Pitch Black Darkness, Safe From Pain

Day/Night Cycle?

# What Is Sin?
Humanity? We can just call it humanity. Could be free choice.
At the end of the day, it is subjectively bad. It makes good people do bad things.
It has to be something beyond the Mist. It has to be a force that exists on its own.
Like a virus that infects. It damns them to this place. But what good comes from it? There must be some subjective good.
It opens people up to see beyond the mist. It lets people choose for themselves, to act outside of the control of Avatars. To see what others cannot. To do what others would not.
Sin overrides mythos. Sleepers can see into the mist without awakening. Their legend is not realized, instead they become a sinner.
Once a sinner, always a sinner. They cannot go back to sleep. When they die, they go to hell. They slowly lose their sense of good and give into selfishness and evil. This is often a product of realizing there is more to the world to experience, as well as their newfound knowledge and power.
Some people use Sin to do good. Despite knowing that the world is shitty and that nothing is real, their loss of inhibitions leads to a greater good than what would have existed otherwise.
Sin leads to more sin. The same way rifts might awaken sleepers, sinners may infect others with sin.

Or maybe, sin is sleeping? Sin is ignorance? The original sin is forgetting?

Demonic Virus that wakes people up.

# The Roguelike
Dante's Inferno, 9 Circles of Hell
Diyu, Chinese hell, 10 courts of yanluo or 18 levels of hell.
Hades, greek underworld

Hell in flux, there is no set "Hell" yet. Yet, there are tellings of multiple circles, multiple levels, multiple hells. So

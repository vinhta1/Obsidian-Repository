## Tools and Materials
#### Game platform: Phaser
### Game engines/frameworks looked at
We’re looking at Phaser for its familiarity amongst the dev team, as well as its capability in creating 2D games for web browsers. It uses JavaScript, which we have been using so far this quarter, and it is also a framework we have all made games with before in the past. This will allow us to hit the ground running and get the game out the door as soon as possible. It also has the benefit of being system friendly for programmers, unlike Unity or Unreal which takes a lot of space and power to run and create with. We think Phaser matches our aesthetic and design goals, while also satisfying our technical goals.

### Programming languages going to be used
#### JavaScript/TypeScript and JSON
We’re planning to use TypeScript for our project because the team is used to working with the language from this class and it’s fresh in everybody’s mind. Everyone also has previous experience working with JavaScript and Phaser, so we don’t have to learn a new game engine from scratch. TypeScript also has other benefits, with the most useful feature being that it is a strongly typed language. JSON would be used because of its compatibility with JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Expected tools to use
- **Ableton** - for audio production. It is the digital audio workstation the audio designer is most familiar with.
- **Photoshop and other Adobe programs**
- **Deno** - A capable package manager for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **VS Code** - We’re using VS Code over other code editors for its customizability and simplicity. It’ll let us add our own auto formatting and code checking. It is also very familiar to the dev team.
- **GitHub** - The most popular choice for source control and collaboration. We’ll be using this to keep our code updated between members.
- **Google Workspace** - for documentation. This suite of tools is good for making documents and slide decks for design and brainstorming. Highly accessible for the dev team, because it doesn’t require any downloads or payments. We won’t be needing any fancy tools for documentation or paper prototyping.
### Alternate platform choices
When switching platforms, we plan on utilizing and launching on p5.js because it is another framework that can be used to create and upload games on a web browser. It uses JavaScript as well, which will let us port the game over more easily.

## PLAYER LORE
Why did Michael come down from their avatar state?
- How is it related to Jerri, who woke up about the same time?
- Is it related to the Cult? Is it related to the Gatekeepers?
**Michael renewed the prophecy, renewing all the Archangels.**
- After the prophecy was fulfilled, an evil force was supposed to be erased for good.
- That evil force was not eliminated.
- After years of work, Michael realized that the prophecy was never fulfilled.
- Thus, using the rest of their powers of Avatarhood, Michael has reawakened the rifts of the Archangels. Nero denies Lucifer, and thus a new rift was chosen instead: Jerri. Shortly after, Icarus is back in control.
Where is Ewan's parents?
**This is to be left unknown until an answer is stumbled upon.**
- Just an accident? Replaced by a copy? They meant to abandon him?

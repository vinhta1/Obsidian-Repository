# About Jina
Jina, beach bum and surfer. Good vibes all around (Sariel) 
[Sariel] Powers: Uhhh… Hard to find. Maybe tank? I found something on invulnerability, but hard to parse if that’s just her or most archangels.

Jina has been trapped in Hell for years now, frozen in time in an endless battle against a spawn of demons. Adorned in a giant suit of pale plate armor, stained in soot, dark ichor, blood, and brimstone. the sun bounces off the clean parts of armor, like quartz in a geode. The reflection would itself be a beacon, if the sounds of combat weren't sufficient enough. Other than the armor, she is armed with a shield. This, along with her fighting spirit and a fist tightly wrapped in rope, is her choice preference of combat.

One might think the armor slows her down, but she is surprisingly and dangerously nimble. Though she doesn't have the martial prowess, speed, or powers of her comrades, she is a rock. She is the battering ram and the wall.

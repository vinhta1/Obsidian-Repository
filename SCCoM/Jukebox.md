# Jerri
## Fight Music
*"Songs that I see for fighting with how Jerri is currently"*
- [Panic Room - Au/Ra](https://youtu.be/HFD_DURA-N0?si=MFSbAx5Ip819xF2T)
- [Panic Room (Acoustic)](https://youtu.be/FVT9NVHQ7NU?si=YzD_htqlyJdobREM)
- [Rebecca Black - Do You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPDARrwrdMM)
- [ABBA - The Winner Takes It All (Official Lyric Video)](https://youtu.be/81WhM9dOcYI?si=TY-xeif9Lv7KiuM1)
	- During and after burning an organization or building (church) to the ground.
	- *"My idea was IF Jerri ends up going full avatar and forces Icarus to kill her, then this is the song that would play during their final battle"*
- [Unlike Pluto - Oh Raven (Sing Me A Happy Song)](https://youtu.be/cl_NE_Si7hI?si=nbJsyOPQBmyFowOF)
- [Ghost - Mary On A Cross](https://youtu.be/k5mX3NkA7jM?si=S9eQD9rygNrvq5al)
- [The Animals - House Of The Rising Sun](https://youtu.be/AEuFaRBGDcw?si=_rJ_nuXxe5is8OJF) 
	- Reminds me of a western, like walking away from a duel or preparing for one.
## Emotional
*"\[Songs that] could be applied specifically to Icarus's and Jerri's relationship with the whole lucifer and archangel dichotomy or other general emotional situations"*
- [Vera Lynn - We'll Meet Again](https://youtu.be/HsM_VmN6ytk?si=eSazsLC-cTzNfXrN)
	- That old-timey vintage jazz sound. Fallout, Watchmen.
	- Maybe a moment between Jerri, Icarus, and Nero, before they walk away from each other.
- [Emma Blackery - Icarus](https://youtu.be/TklEhgZql4Q?si=4KmJmtczHhuSPkjK)
	- Feels like a credits song after Jerri and Icarus has had a heart to heart, but Icarus isn't listening.
- [ayokay - Don't Wanna Be Your Friend ft. Katie Pearlman](https://youtu.be/yNIzCtbshn0?si=FLg-n1pjBvEsFAmy)
	- In one way, could be Icarus and Jerri getting closer (romantically?). I also see it like the mythos are trying to take over themselves, losing control of themselves. It could also be a moment between Nero and Jerri.

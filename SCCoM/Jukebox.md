## Fight Music
- [The Animals - House Of The Rising Sun](https://youtu.be/AEuFaRBGDcw?si=_rJ_nuXxe5is8OJF) 
	- Reminds me of a western, like walking away from a duel or preparing for one.
- [Kiss - I was Made For Lovin' You](https://youtu.be/kLKr342VKaU?si=b3yDXTU9FJsRNMNF)
	- Disco rock for when you're beating people up with your romantic interest.
# Jerri
## Fight Music
*"Songs that I see for fighting with how Jerri is currently"*
- [Panic Room - Au/Ra](https://youtu.be/HFD_DURA-N0?si=MFSbAx5Ip819xF2T)
- [Trust Issues - Emei](https://youtu.be/qejvs16xGZA?si=ZZeeyJNYa2X8V4p9)
- [Army of Lovers - Crucified](https://youtu.be/ab-IImsyhNM?si=rU2iyHY3UCM1k8YJ)
	- Feels like a comeback song, a place of defeat and despair that turns around. Could apply to all fight songs though.
- [Will Wood - Laplace's Angel (Hurt People? Hurt People!)](https://youtu.be/4rX5a3bnG4s?si=du58pnXCyAWiZDdy)
	- Both parties on the move, a little playful.
- [Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) (2018 Remaster)](https://youtu.be/HYwNM1t9ltI?si=craGdAAn6Ky1ln_n)
	- An uphill battle. Maybe another comeback song.
- [Fleetwood Mac - The Chain](https://youtu.be/xwTPvcPYaOo?si=NXvfwboBrSnekTqi)
- [Duran Duran - Danse Macabre](https://youtu.be/BpWrSTBP5rg?si=9jB89OKwNPeLaiX4)

## Emotional
*"\[Songs that] could be applied specifically to Icarus's and Jerri's relationship with the whole lucifer and archangel dichotomy or other general emotional situations"*
- [Vera Lynn - We'll Meet Again](https://youtu.be/HsM_VmN6ytk?si=eSazsLC-cTzNfXrN)
	- That old-timey vintage jazz sound. Fallout, Watchmen.
	- Maybe a moment between Jerri, Icarus, and Nero, before they walk away from each other.
- [Emma Blackery - Icarus](https://youtu.be/TklEhgZql4Q?si=4KmJmtczHhuSPkjK)
	- Feels like a credits song after Jerri and Icarus has had a heart to heart, but Icarus isn't listening.
- [ayokay - Don't Wanna Be Your Friend ft. Katie Pearlman](https://youtu.be/yNIzCtbshn0?si=FLg-n1pjBvEsFAmy)
	- In one way, could be Icarus and Jerri getting closer (romantically?). I also see it like the mythos are trying to take over themselves, losing control of themselves. It could also be a moment between Nero and Jerri.
- [Hozier - From Eden](https://youtu.be/JmWbBUxSNUU?si=GJNJzfyQPZgs1B1s)
- [Panic Room (Acoustic)](https://youtu.be/FVT9NVHQ7NU?si=YzD_htqlyJdobREM)
	- Acoustic version of fight music. Maybe when things go wrong, or when Jerri's fighting herself.
- [Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) (2018 Remaster)](https://youtu.be/HYwNM1t9ltI?si=craGdAAn6Ky1ln_n)
	- If only two people could feel what each other is feeling. To swap perspectives. They don't mean to hurt each other but they do.
## Confronting Her Past
- [Beyonc√© - DAUGHTER](https://youtu.be/cjeC0zNqigo?si=lvs_-eIdggFxh1rT)
	- Reminds me of the inability to escape one's true identity, one's history, one's mythos. Killing someone who pissed you off, and feeling torn about where the fury came from.
- [Depeche Mode - Blasphemous Rumours](https://youtu.be/z6wygmw2wPA?si=zaja6IvMZoRk0sV9)
	- Very 80's, about a girl who attempts suicide and lives, but dies after becoming happy with life.
- [Lazarus (Radio Edit)](https://youtu.be/XCZaEW6nY7k?si=u1nmi-h-Ca67oGvv)

## Scene Specific
- [Rebecca Black - Do You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPDARrwrdMM)
- [ABBA - The Winner Takes It All (Official Lyric Video)](https://youtu.be/81WhM9dOcYI?si=TY-xeif9Lv7KiuM1)
	- During and after burning an organization or building (church) to the ground.
	- *"My idea was IF Jerri ends up going full avatar and forces Icarus to kill her, then this is the song that would play during their final battle."*
- [Unlike Pluto - Oh Raven (Sing Me A Happy Song)](https://youtu.be/cl_NE_Si7hI?si=nbJsyOPQBmyFowOF)
- [Ghost - Mary On A Cross](https://youtu.be/k5mX3NkA7jM?si=S9eQD9rygNrvq5al)

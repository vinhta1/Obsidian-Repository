#Case Jack and the Beanstalk
# Background
There was a wild party last night at **Tree 9**. **Jack Benson** made lean with some Magic Jolly Ranchers. Consuming the drink, and thus the jolly ranchers, compelled Jack to climb Tree 9. Two people, who also consumed the lean, climbed up there with him.

This morning, Jack had fell hundreds of feet to his death.

Most of the area has been cleaned up already, no foldable tables or solo cups in sight. There are, however, some items that haven't been claimed by anyone near the tree itself.

#Case Jack and the Beanstalk
# Background
There was a wild party last night at **Tree 9**. **Jack Benson** made lean with some Magic Jolly Ranchers. Consuming the drink, and thus the jolly ranchers, compelled Jack to climb Tree 9. Two people who also consumed the lean, Reynard and Brandon, climbed up there with him.
	The party ended a couple hours after, around 1-2 AM. Most of the party has been cleaned up already, but there are a few tables and solo cups on site. Additionally, some items that haven't been claimed by anyone near the tree itself.

The climbing didn't stop at the top of the tree. In fact, it extended past the top of the tree into the sky. At the top is a castle. Jack, Reynard, and Brandon went inside. They befriended a giant women, but had to hide when her husband came back. Jack opted to make a run for it, and he ran out the door with the giant in tow.

Early in the morning, at around 3-4 AM, Jack had fell hundreds of feet to his death. At around 6-7 AM, the dead body was called in. Police are on the scene are investigating, and will most likely categorize this as a death from misadventure.

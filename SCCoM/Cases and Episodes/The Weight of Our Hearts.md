#Case Danny's Case, Anubis, Itzpapalotl

# Background
### Izzy, the Organ Hunter
Izzy doesn't know what came first: her hunger for flesh or her awakening. Ever since the day she carved into the man that invaded her apartment, she was never the same. During the day, she would save lives in Dominican Hospital as a surgeon. During the night, she would stalk criminals in dark corners where no one would see them. Then, she'd strike.
Her modus operandi is constant. First, tranquilize the targets from afar with a blowgun so they can't fight back. Then, drill straight into their leg bone with an IO needle and inject them with sedatives, so they fall into a deep sleep. Third, carve open their chest to extract their organs, especially their still-beating heart. If she can't help it, she'll eat right then and there. Lastly, take a limb to cook at home.
One day, a wealthy man came to the hospital looking for a heart transplant. There was a long list ahead of him, there was simply not enough time for an organ to become available for him, nor anyone on that list for that matter. He demands to be moved higher, quoting his importance. Months pass. People die. Organs become available just for people with higher priorities outside the City to take them from those waiting for months. More people die. She'd give them the organs she was eating in a heart beat. But how could she explain were she got them from? How would they even react if they ever found out where they came from? Could they live with that? Could she live with that? She takes another bite out of her meal, and eats away her turmoil.
Sometime later, she sees the same wealthy man from before, healthier than ever. Was it a miracle, or was it a price tag? She talks to a coworker who knew the wealthy man, and not before long she makes contact with a transplant center, hidden in the heart of Santa Cruz Suburbia. Dealers, traffickers, amateur surgeons. The operation was sloppy, but it worked. But then she found out where the organs where coming from.
It always started with a debt. Someone who owed a little too much money to the wrong people. Or maybe it was a pair of relatives or friends who couldn't afford a hospital transplant. Just one kidney, they think. Just a piece of their liver, they think. Some of them never opened their eyes after they went under; those were the people who were deemed loners. They wouldn't have been missed. At least, that was the best justification the traffickers could give after seeing their entrails pulled out in front of them. It was sloppy, but it worked. From then on, she hunted organ traffickers. She'll make sure to eat every last one of them.

### Susan, Judge of the Dead
"Their heart's missing again." Missing organs usually aren't a problem for most morticians, sure. The cut's so clean, it's as if they were never opened in the first place, and maybe a prosthetic can be used in place of the missing pieces. But their hearts; they need their hearts to be judged. Susan closes her eyes, and blue fire filters through her eyelids like they were being snuffed out and raged against it.
The man in front of her disappears, and the table he occupies turns to sand and sinks into the grains. The still-air howls and shifts. The new winds blow around her, peacefully, solemnly. A desert filled with white evening primroses surrounds her. Nothing had changed in reality: she stares down at the cadaver.
In the desert, the man is nowhere to be seen. The ones without hearts can never be found. Maybe the have moved on to paradise. Maybe their souls have been devoured. Maybe they're just taking their time. She stands and waits, just in case.
She finishes up the last of the bodies and throws away her gloves. She zips up her jacket, grabs her cane, and puts on her baseball cap. As she walks out into the night in all black, she pulls her mask up. It's time to judge a killer.

### The Timeline
**A few years ago**: Susan is awakened.
**Several months ago**: Izzy is awakened around the same time she starts to eat people.
**A few months ago**: Susan starts trying to find out who is stealing people's organs.
**A couple months ago**: Izzy starts targeting organ traffickers.
**A week ago**: Scratchy is ordered to make the deal with Danny, despite fearing that he will be killed.
**8PM**: Danny and Scratchy make the deal, only to be killed by Izzy. Danny survives, but because they are sedated they stay asleep for a while longer. Her heart isn't taken, because it's "tainted." Their body heals naturally.
**8:30PM**: Susan finds the bodies, but is too late. She assumes they're both dead. She waits to see if the killer returns.

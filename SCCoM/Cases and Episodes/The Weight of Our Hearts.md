#Case Danny's Case, Anubis, Itzpapalotl

# Background
Organ trafficking isn't rampant by any means, but it creates a mass of victims all the same. Donors are manipulated and harmed. People lose more organs than they agreed to, or find themselves still deep in debt after using the money they received, unable to go back to work. Recipients are conned and sometimes left worse than they were before. Sometimes it's being charged tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and sometimes it's faulty organs that don't work well or are incompatible, leading to their deaths shortly after. The transplant centers are nowhere to be found the next day and the middlemen pocket all the money. There are only two places to reliably get a transplant in this city: the hospital, or **Viktor (Cyberpunk 2077)**'s clinic.
**Isabel Lotero (Itzpapalotl)** is a surgeon who has been eating criminals alive. In fact, eating these people is empowering her, allowing her to deliver justice further. She starts to develop a craving she worries she can't contain or sustain. So, she eases up and eats less. However, she has recently started targeting organ traffickers after witnessing the deaths of many patients who couldn't get an organ in time and after seeing how the donors are treated by these traffickers. After fully giving in, she might have crossed a point of no return.
**Susan Rashad (Nasus/Anubis)** is a mortician who works at the same hospital as Isabel, who finds themselves guiding the dead to a better place. For those who are found wanting or guilty, she attempts to complete their last will or wish so that they may finally move on. However, with the increase of dead people coming into the morgue without hearts, Susan is concerned. She sets out to find the person taking people's hearts.
**Scratchy (Sleeper)** has recently been extorted to make an organ trade by opposing organ traffickers, despite the news of traffickers and dealers being targeted and working exclusively with Viktor. Of course, Isabel is waiting. It is too late when Susan arrives on the scene, but maybe she can still find suspects.
Scratchy is dead, and his organs have been removed.
Isabel wants to end the organ trafficking ring.
Susan wants to stop whoever is taking people's hearts.
### Izzy, the Organ Hunter
Izzy doesn't know what came first: her hunger for flesh or her awakening. Ever since the day she carved into the man that invaded her apartment, she was never the same. During the day, she would save lives in Dominican Hospital as a surgeon. During the night, she would stalk criminals in dark corners where no one would see them. Then, she'd strike.
Her modus operandi is constant. First, tranquilize the targets from afar with a blowgun so they can't fight back. Then, drill straight into their leg bone with an IO needle and inject them with sedatives, so they fall into a deep sleep. Third, carve open their chest to extract their organs, especially their still-beating heart. If she can't help it, she'll eat right then and there. Lastly, take a limb to cook at home.
One day, a wealthy man came to the hospital looking for a heart transplant. There was a long list ahead of him, there was simply not enough time for an organ to become available for him, nor anyone on that list for that matter. He demands to be moved higher, quoting his importance. Months pass. People die. Organs become available just for people with higher priorities outside the City to take them from those waiting for months. More people die. She'd give them the organs she was eating in a heart beat. But how could she explain were she got them from? How would they even react if they ever found out where they came from? Could they live with that? Could she live with that? She takes another bite out of her meal, and eats away her turmoil.
Sometime later, she sees the same wealthy man from before, healthier than ever. Was it a miracle, or was it a price tag? She talks to a coworker who knew the wealthy man, and not before long she makes contact with a transplant center, hidden in the heart of Santa Cruz Suburbia. Dealers, traffickers, amateur surgeons. The operation was sloppy, but it worked. But then she found out where the organs where coming from.
It always started with a debt. Someone who owed a little too much money to the wrong people. Or maybe it was a pair of relatives or friends who couldn't afford a hospital transplant. Just one kidney, they think. Just a piece of their liver, they think. Some of them never opened their eyes after they went under; those were the people who were deemed loners. They wouldn't have been missed. At least, that was the best justification the traffickers could give after seeing their entrails pulled out in front of them. It was sloppy, but it worked. From then on, she hunted organ traffickers. She'll make sure to eat every last one of them.

### Susan, Judge of the Dead
"Their heart's missing again." Missing organs usually aren't a problem for most morticians, sure. The cut's so clean, it's as if they were never opened in the first place, and maybe a prosthetic can be used in place of the missing pieces. But their hearts; they need their hearts to be judged. Susan closes her eyes, and blue fire filters through her eyelids like they were being snuffed out and raged against it.
The man in front of her disappears, and the table he occupies turns to sand and sinks into the grains. The still-air howls and shifts. The new winds blow around her, peacefully, solemnly. A desert filled with white evening primroses surrounds her. Nothing had changed in reality: she stares down at the cadaver.
In the desert, the man is nowhere to be seen. The ones without hearts can never be found. Maybe the have moved on to paradise. Maybe their souls have been devoured. Maybe they're just taking their time. She stands and waits, just in case.
She finishes up the last of the bodies and throws away her gloves. She zips up her jacket, grabs her cane, and puts on her baseball cap. As she walks out into the night in all black, she pulls her mask up. It's time to judge a killer.

### The Timeline
**A few years ago**: Susan is awakened.
**Several months ago**: Izzy is awakened around the same time she starts to eat people.
**A few months ago**: Susan starts trying to find out who is stealing people's organs.
**A couple months ago**: Izzy starts targeting organ traffickers.
**A week ago**: Scratchy is extorted to make an organ trade by the traffickers, despite fearing that he will be killed.
**8PM**: Danny and Scratchy make the deal, only to be killed by Izzy. Danny survives, but because they are sedated they stay asleep for a while longer. Her heart isn't taken, because it's "tainted." Their body heals naturally.
**8:30PM**: Susan finds the bodies, but is too late. She assumes they're both dead. She waits to see if the killer returns.
# Investigation
##### At the **alleyway**, where Susan is watching:
- Scratchy's body is missing a leg and his organs.
- A second body, in a similar state.
- There wasn't a struggle, but there are gashes in the ground where their limbs were severed.
- Nearby, Izzy might have ate one of the organs. On the bodies, there might be some black volcanic rock shards.
##### At the hospital **morgue**, where Susan works:
- Out of the people who've come in recently without organs, organ traffickers are the most common ones, then violent criminals, then organ donors.
- Those marked as donors are not missing limbs.
- Someone with appropriate contacts can learn that the victims lose their organs by the time authorities arrive UNLESS they are donors, in which they have died in the hospital instead.
##### At the **hospital ward**, where Izzy works:
- Izzy is a surgeon, overseeing many invasive surgeries. She's great at her job, but she can't save everyone.
- An inventory check and gossip shows that someone has been stealing medical supplies, including sedatives and tranquilizers.
- Some newer organ donors were violent offenders, who came in on the brink of death. "Nasty stuff, both them and their wounds." They almost always never made it.

# Showdown
The clues should have pointed to the hospital and that one of the workers, likely a skilled practitioner, was behind these recent killings. Isabel will only reveal herself when forced into a corner or when hunting dealers at night. Because of how little she can control herself when she gives into her hunger, she will prefer to be away from the public. It is in the crew's best interests to confront her in an isolated place as well. The more access she has to helpless people, the stronger she is. She cannot control whether or not she transforms. When she does, it's a fight to the death or until the sun rises. Thus, let the crew know that they can set up where the showdown will ultimately take place.
# Aftermath
- How does Susan feel about the party now? Will she continue to help the crew or the city?
- If Isabel's alive, will she be brought to justice? What are the implications for the city and its crime rings? What about their citizens?
- If the case ends up having too much collateral damage or too many witnesses, how do the **Gatekeepers** respond?

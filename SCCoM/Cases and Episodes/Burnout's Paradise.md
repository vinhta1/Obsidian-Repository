### The office lady life
An ordinary lady is looking for one of the players to help them have "one good day"
In her mind, this is her last day on earth.
Is she a rift? Is she a sleeper? You can't really tell. But she is paying well.
She works in the skyscraper on the edge of downtown.
A skyscraper that no one can see.
She does not want to go anywhere near it, but she can tough it out. She will definitely NOT go inside.

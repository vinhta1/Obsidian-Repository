### The office lady life
An ordinary lady is looking for one of the players to help them finish out one of their bucket lists. In her mind, this is her last day on earth.
Is she a rift? Is she a sleeper? You can't really tell.
She works in the skyscraper on the edge of downtown.
She does NOT want to go anywhere near it, but she can tough it out. She will definitely not go inside.

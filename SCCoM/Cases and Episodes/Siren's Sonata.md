#Case Sirens, The Little Mermaid

# Background

### Call of the ocean
Someone tried to walk into the ocean and drown themselves.
They weren't fully aware of their actions.
They can be visited at the Dominican hospital, if you can find out which room they're in and convince the staff to let you visit.
They have insomnia. They've recently developed depression and numbness.
Amongst their personal belongings is a drug, a small bag of teal capsules/tablets.
It is called Sauna/Sonata.
## The new drug on the block, Sonata
Related to Zaleplon (Generic Sonata)? Stealing the name?
People are going walking into the ocean, sinking like rocks.
The cover: originally built to help with sleep, turns out to be a pretty good depressant when combined with some other choice compounds.
The reality: Increases susceptibility to certain Rifts (hypnotization, influence).
After having enough, they can hear the sirens. (Song stuck in their head status).
Effects: increased sensitivity, warped perception of time, drowsiness, dilated pupils, reduced anxiety/stillness of mind
Side effects: depression, anterograde amnesia, narcolepsy, increased blood pressure/heart rate, dullness in mind/emotion/feeling
### Counterfeit Creators
There are two brothers trying hard to recreate the drug.
They have three friends peddling the drug.
It's pretty good, but it's not the same (since it doesn't have the mystical properties the real stuff has).
Their most recent batch is exactly the same though. They used Lullaby.
They make it in a garage.
### Prescriptions and Spiked Drinks
Sonata is starting to roll out in local, smaller pharmacies under a different name: Sirenonazepam (Generic Lullaby)
A benzodiazepine class drug given for people with insomnia and other sleep related issues.
"It's just a safer sleeping pill, really."
Someone has been caught slipping the tablets into drinks at bars.
Taking an overdose of sirenonazepam or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with sirenonazepam may lead toÂ **breathing problems and unconsciousness**. Some signs of an overdose include: clumsiness or unsteadiness, confusion, severe drowsiness, low blood pressure, unusual dullness or feeling sluggish, and troubled breathing.
All clues lead to Mission Pharma being distributers.
### Developed by Helix Labs, produced in unmarked warehouses
Under a cover company: Mission Pharmaceuticals, a pop up lab on Mission St.
If it's being made in a lab, its not this one. In fact, it's just a front with a basement. But, where is it being made then? And what are they making here?
Warehouses full of drug workers that believe that they will be rewarded for what they are doing.
Is it blackmail? Is it manipulation? Is it something beyond the mundane? **They cannot and will not say.** They are all mute.
The truth: They are all sirens that gave up their voices to live in the city. They took an unfair contract that they cannot go back on. Most of them don't express themselves. The ones that do, seem like good enough people.
They definitely do NOT take Sonata.

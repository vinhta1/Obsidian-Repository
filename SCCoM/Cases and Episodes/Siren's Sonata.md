# Background
## The new drug on the block, Sonata
Related to Zaleplon (Generic Sonata)? Just a play on the name?
People are going walking into the ocean, sinking like rocks.
The cover: originally built to help with sleep, turns out to be a pretty good depressant when combined with some other choice compounds.
The reality: Increases susceptibility to certain Rifts (hypnotization, influence).
After having enough, they can hear the sirens. (Song stuck in their head status).
Effects: increased sensitivity, warped perception of time, drowsiness, dilated pupils, reduced anxiety/stillness of mind
Side effects: depression, anterograde amnesia, narcolepsy, increased blood pressure/heart rate, dullness in mind/emotion/feeling

### Developed by Helix Labs, produced in unmarked warehouses
Under a cover company: Mission Pharmaceuticals, a pop up lab on Mission St.
If it's being made in a lab, its not this one.
Warehouses full of drug workers that believe that they will be rewarded for what they are doing.
Faith in something beyond one's imagination.
Is it blackmail? Is it manipulation? Is it something beyond the mundane? **This is unanswered.**

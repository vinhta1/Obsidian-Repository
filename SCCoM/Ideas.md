Grim Reaper/Prosfair
Looks like chess. No one knows the game, but everyone knows how to play.
Each move adds to the Complexity tag. For each tier, subtract one power from Go-toe-to-toe rolls.
Go-toe-to-toe results
- 10+: Checkmate status gains 1-tier.
- 7-9: Nothing happens.
- 6-: Death status gains 1-tier.

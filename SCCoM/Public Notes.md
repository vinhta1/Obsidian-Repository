Maru Mart Diary from "What about the old Lucifer?"
- Blue, worn-down, written in Chinese, shoplifted.
- Only the first page has writing. It is in Chinese.
	- "You are my fire. You are my light. You are the reason I'm awake at night."
- The rest of the pages are blank.
- There is no way to tell how old this book is. It's just, "old"?.
- "How does this pertain to you?"
	  **It has nothing to do with me.**
	  *It has everything to do with me.*
  - "Did the previous Lucifer own this book?"
	  - *It is a shadow of the original.*
	  - **Chuckles**

Maru Mart Diary from "What about the old Lucifer?"
- Blue, worn-down, written in Chinese, shoplifted.
- Only the first page has writing. It is in Chinese.
	- "You are my fire. You are my light. You are the reason I'm awake at night."
- The rest of the pages are blank.

Jerri visits a Chinese professor and finds out what the first page reads.
- "You are my fire. You are my light. You are the reason I'm awake at night."

- There is no way to tell how old this book is. It's just, "old"?.
She Looks Beyond the Mist:
She sits down on the ground, back against the wall. She pulls out a tall candle, and stares at the flame, like a s√©ance. The shadows grow long, until the room is black. A single light in a void, which fills with bright fog. You can't tell where you are. A limbo. And then there's Jerri. Her mind is elsewhere. Her eyes are glossy. A demon 
- "How does this pertain to you?"
	  **It has nothing to do with me.**
	  *It has everything to do with me.*
  - "Did the previous Lucifer own this book?"
	  - *It is a shadow of the original.*
	  - **Chuckles**

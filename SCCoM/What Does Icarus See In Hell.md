Murder vacation for Icarus. He's OP AS HELL, in Hell as well!
Souls of the damned, demons.
He doesn't see any of old Chinatown
He does, however, see the old archangels, if more than just one

Black Rock Sulfur Key can get into and out of portals.
Collect more to gain hell powers. Grantable to others (like the feathers)
Collect them all to create the devil's diadem.

# The Hierarchy of Hell
There is no Satan. Chaos is the rule of the land. Most people try to escape, until they warp, and then they hunt others.
The land itself is evil. It turns people into demons. It warps their mind. It twists their being.
Archangels are exempt from turning
Nero (fakes) are not.

Is Nero even in hell? The fake Neros would be in New Chinatown wouldn't they?

# What Does Hell Look Like

Crystalline Yellow, Soot and Ash Fields and Paths
A Realm on Fire, Burning Blue, Smoking Grey
Red Suns Like Eyes, Watching, Smiling? Tormenting All
Pockets of Pitch Black Darkness, Safe From Pain

Day/Night Cycle?

# What Is Sin?
Humanity? We can just call it humanity. Could be free choice.
At the end of the day, it is subjectively bad. It makes good people do bad things.
It has to be something beyond the Mist. It has to be a force that exists on its own.
Like a virus that infects. It damns them to this place. But what good comes from it? There must be some subjective good.
It opens people up to see beyond the mist. It lets people choose for themselves, to act outside of the control of Avatars. To see what others cannot. To do what others would not.
Sin overrides mythos. Sleepers can see into the mist without awakening. Their legend is not realized, instead they become a sinner.
Once a sinner, always a sinner. They cannot go back to sleep. When they die, they go to hell. They lose their sense of good, and give into selfishness and evil.

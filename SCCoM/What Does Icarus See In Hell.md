# The Hierarchy of Hell
There is no Satan. Chaos is the rule of the land. Most people try to escape, until they warp, and then they hunt others.
The land itself is evil. It turns people, melts them down into their base selves. And then eventually just their souls. 
Archangels are exempt from turning
Nero (fakes) are not.

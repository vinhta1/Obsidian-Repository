Murder vacation for Icarus. He's OP AS HELL, in Hell as well!
Souls of the damned, demons.
He doesn't see any of old Chinatown
He does, however, see the old archangels, if more than just one

Black Rock Sulfur Key can get into and out of portals.
Collect more to gain hell powers. Grantable to others (like the feathers)
Collect them all to create the devil's diadem.

# The Hierarchy of Hell
There is no Satan. Chaos is the rule of the land. Most people try to escape, until they warp, and then they hunt others.
The land itself is evil. It turns people into demons. It warps their mind. It twists their being.
Archangels are exempt from turning
Nero (fakes) are not.

Is Nero even in hell? The fake Neros would be in New Chinatown wouldn't they?

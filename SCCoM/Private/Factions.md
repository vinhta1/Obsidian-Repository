# New Chinatown, Gatekeepers
### Goal: Maintain the Mist, Attend to the Ghosts
They've been stretched thin since their founding, about a decade after they lost the Last Chinatown. Established underneath UCSC, they take the time to protect and assist the Mist and the natural order of things. Most rifts operate just fine, since their dealings look like everyday happenings at best. There's enough evil in the world to justify anything nowadays. But when things get a little too weird, they're there to uproot the weeds. Order and ordinary is everything to the Gatekeepers. They don't want a repeat of history. Thus, the Gatekeepers and Avatars have a mutual yet bitter and fragile agreement.

New Chinatown is also the home of the ghosts of their ancestors and relatives. Thus, is it also the Gatekeepers' priority to attend to them and bring hungry ghosts home. There's even a sector in the department dedicated to this task.
### Grey Suits and Old Tradition
Business/business casual to casual/plainclothes attire
When in proper uniform, gatekeepers will usually will stick to grey. Of course, the higher up's clothes will match whatever the crowd is wearing, almost changing at a dime. Blink and you'll miss it, stare and you'll forget it. ‰øù
### DMO: Distract, Mask, Obliviate
If someone saw something they shouldn't have, they didn't. Using their vast intelligence network and methods of divination, Gatekeepers can put agents on the scene before anything happens. These agents follow the DMO motto and take proper precautions to make sure no one realizes something is off, lest they awaken. Their job isn't to stop crime, it's to stop Rifts from waking up others. Thus much to many Gatekeeper's chagrin, if it looks normal enough, it's not their priority.

# Boardwalk Boys Conglomerate
### Goal: Have a Good Time and Exploit Everyone to do it
These brats are spoiled and they use it to get whatever they want. Whether it's their parents or the kids at their schools and neighborhoods, they're gonna milk them dry and make sure no one stops them. They're popular, they're cunning, and they're ruthless.
### Thrones Built on the Backs of Others
The BBC are made up of a collective of powerful factions around Santa Cruz: the Bikers, the Aces, and the Bricks. These factions are built on a fragile alliance after days of negotiations, and this joint operation can break at any moment. If that were to happen, it'd be all out war.
## The Bikers
All you need to join the bikers is a bike. As such it's the easiest group of the BBC to join. The bikes of choice are motorized, typically dirt bikes. Of course, off-road helmets are required; you wouldn't want to get caught hitting someone with a metal pipe. The speed demons, the thrill-seekers, these are the people who you can't run from or catch up to.
For those who rather stay unmotorized, they're typically the silent type. Just as capable and unhinged as their loud counterparts, they however tend to stay in the shadows and on elevated ground.
Their job is movement, transportation, finding debtors, and "hits".
## The Aces
Some bullies get others to do their homework. The Aces, however, do everyone else's homework. Nothing's half assed, in fact, they take extensive care to make sure whatever you turn in looks as legit as it gets. No one can tell it's not yours, including yourself. Writing assignments, quiz answers, changing grades on records, anything that requires some semblance of brains, forgery, and organization you can think of. The catch? You have to pay for their services. But if you don't have the cash, you can take out debt or pay in favors. That's how they get you. Most kids who don't pay up front are stuck being the fall guys and servants for the BBC.
Their job is making money, overseeing operations, accruing debtors, and espionage.
## The Bricks
The meatheads and the faces of the group. It's always a kid that's bigger than everyone else, or a kid whose parents are high up the ladder. They always use unsavory tactics and they're not afraid of anyone. They tend to exploit the leniency of adults. Classic bullies with a little too much cash and power to have any reason to do otherwise. If they can't punch their way out, they'll talk their way out.
Their job is extorting and harassing kids, tricking and exploiting adults, and holding territory.

# Cleaver Gang, Axe Gang from Kung Fu Hustle
### Goal: Make Money, Send a Message
Extort money from businesses and the locals, pay off the cops, recruit members, rinse and repeat. If the threats of violence won't convince someone, the actualization of violence will. Pure brutality speaks loud here. But when people are a little tougher than expected, they'll break legendary martial artists out of prisons or hire pricey assassins.
### Black Suits and Top Hats
Hoodies and black blazers/coats for casual wear, black top hats when in business.
### The Gun's for Looks; the Cleaver's for Business
Most members of this gang stick to any old meat cleaver they can get their hands on, usually holstered to their back and concealed by their coat. However, when they've got their suit on, they sometimes don't bother with hiding their knives. Officers tend to carry a sidearm as well, but will more often send their goons out if they ever need to protect themselves or end someone.

# The Black Company

### Goal: Work. Advance. Profit.
The Black Company isn't one faction. It is more like a conglomerate. A meat grinder that young and aspiring people walk into willingly, only to come out without a will to live. That isn't to say that this company isn't necessary. In fact, it has led to many revolutions in every field: medical advancements, technological breakthroughs, you name it. But behind closed doors and buried underneath paperwork and bureaucracy, things that shouldn't exist are contained in concrete and linoleum cells. Research on Rifts, Relics, and further anomalies are performed in the pursuit of progress, often citing it's "for the good of everyone." Once again, it isn't a faction, or even a singular entity. But if you want to find where all the weird is happening, the headquarters can be found right in the middle of Santa Cruz: a towering pure black monolith that no one can seem to see.
### Dress for Work, and Don't Forget Your Lanyard
Business attire and IDs in plastic covers worn around necks. The IDs belong to some front company most of the time, depending on the branch they work for, and often are employed just to take the fall when the time comes for it despite being highly qualified. You'll see many of them wear Band-Aids behind their ankles.
### NDAs, Task Forces, and a Million Fronts
Everything is technically legal on paper. Exploiting a million loopholes while seemingly having none of their own, all this paperwork is comprehensive and daunting. But if the system can't be beat, it can be gamed. However, if the excessive bureaucracy doesn't stop you, their mobile task forces will. Don't think they're just guys with Kevlar and rifles either, they are built to counter, nullify, and capture, if not kill, Rifts. The moment you step through that front door, you might already be in their sights. That is, if you can find the front door. They go by a million names, businesses as fronts, but they're all them. They do everything because they can hide anywhere. Places will pop up just to disappear the next day.

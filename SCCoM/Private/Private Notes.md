## Player Expectations
Peter wants to be OP, contractually cannot lose a fight. Always thinking about fight scenes. Jason Statham, Raid, John Wick, big battles all the time.
- More fights, clear trash and big mobs. Bombastic, cinematic, one against many, one against the world.
Kayley wants me to capture childhood wonder. The feeling when everything in life is the funniest thing. Jubilee, amazement, joy, wanderlust.
- Worlds within the city. Enclaves and events with awesome sights and interesting characters. Think animated movies and anime.
Jimmy wants classic detective cases, going from clue to clue.
Ewan wants to enroll in school, sister Kiara

## PLAYER LORE
Why did Michael come down from their avatar state?
- How is it related to Jerri, who woke up about the same time?
- Is it related to the Cult? Is it related to the Gatekeepers?
**Michael renewed the prophecy, renewing all the Archangels.**
- After the prophecy was fulfilled, an evil force was supposed to be erased for good.
- That evil force was not eliminated.
- After years of work, Michael realized that the prophecy was never fulfilled.
- Thus, using the rest of their powers of Avatarhood, Michael has reawakened the rifts of the Archangels. Nero denies Lucifer, and thus a new rift was chosen instead: Jerri. Shortly after, Icarus is back in control.
Where is Ewan's parents?
**This is to be left unknown until an answer is stumbled upon.**
- Just an accident? Replaced by a copy? They meant to abandon him?

Before Ewan met Kenneth and the Crew, Ewan kinda just picked up moms and dads. Has a bus mom and dad, train mom and dad, gym mom and dad. Barbie and Ken type parents. Ewan recently made school parents.
Ewan met Kenneth lastly when getting boy loft. Coin = tap to pay, no tap to pay = fucked. Ewan could always walk up to an ATM and withdraw cash... in theory. The painting is somewhere else.

Ewan would only want to be adopted if absolutely had to. Whether or not Ewan knows that is a different question.
The last thing Ewan and Ashley talked about is what's going on, like media and things. Pop culture. Ewan talks, Ashley listens and asks questions.

Ewan and Phil still play games at the arcade. Phil gets close to beating Ewan's PB, but never does.
Kayley's mental model of Phil was around Ewan's age. Two years older isn't too bad, kinda likes the dynamic.

Kayley thinks the crew and the reason why they work together is disjointed.

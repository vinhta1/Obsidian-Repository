## Player Expectations
Peter wants to be OP, contractually cannot lose a fight. Always thinking about fight scenes. Jason Statham, Raid, John Wick, big battles all the time.
- More fights, clear trash and big mobs. Bombastic, cinematic, one against many, one against the world.
Kayley wants me to capture childhood wonder. The feeling when everything in life is the funniest thing. Jubilee, amazement, joy, wanderlust.
- Worlds within the city. Enclaves and events with awesome sights and interesting characters. Think animated movies and anime.
Jimmy wants classic detective cases, going from clue to clue.
Ewan wants to enroll in school, sister Kiara

"LOGOS + MUNDANE = PROFIT"

## PLAYER LORE
Why did Michael come down from their avatar state?
- How is it related to Jerri, who woke up about the same time?
- Is it related to the Cult? Is it related to the Gatekeepers?
**Michael renewed the prophecy, renewing all the Archangels.**
- After the prophecy was fulfilled, an evil force was supposed to be erased for good.
- That evil force was not eliminated.
- After years of work, Michael realized that the prophecy was never fulfilled.
- Thus, using the rest of their powers of Avatarhood, Michael has reawakened the rifts of the Archangels. Nero denies Lucifer, and thus a new rift was chosen instead: Jerri. Shortly after, Icarus is back in control.
Where is Ewan's parents?
**This is to be left unknown until an answer is stumbled upon.**
- Just an accident? Replaced by a copy? They meant to abandon him?

# Session Log
## [[Bodies and the Beanstalk]]
Jolly Ranchers missing from the crime scene, no other evidence connected to crew.
Who's hiding the rift evidence?

Jerri was on break, but did not see the bodies? -> Suspect
- If Jerri or the crew can find an out, no problem. Otherwise, throw a bone/turn it into a case.

Before Ewan met Kenneth and the Crew, Ewan kinda just picked up moms and dads. Has a bus mom and dad, train mom and dad, gym mom and dad. Barbie and Ken type parents. Ewan recently made school parents.
Ewan met Kenneth lastly when getting boy loft. Coin = tap to pay, no tap to pay = fucked. Ewan could always walk up to an ATM and withdraw cash... in theory. The painting is somewhere else.

Ewan would only want to be adopted if absolutely had to. Whether or not Ewan knows that is a different question.
The last thing Ewan and Ashley talked about is what's going on, like media and things. Pop culture. Ewan talks, Ashley listens and asks questions.

Ewan and Phil still play games at the arcade. Phil gets close to beating Ewan's PB, but never does.
Kayley's mental model of Phil was around Ewan's age. Two years older isn't too bad, kinda likes the dynamic.

Kayley thinks the crew and the reason why they work together is disjointed. Would like more cohesion.
Ewan is a child, Kayley didn't make it clear to other players that Kayley is not and would like to be respected. Icarus and Jerri is college mom and college dad. There's Seung-Jin if there's more interactions. Player-wise, it was Jimmy. Ewan in the boy loft will have a TV screen constantly playing VODs of Asmodeus. Always on.
Kayley's reference for Ewan is Phineas from Phineas and Ferb.
Kayley thinks we, as players, need to start shifting our language towards asking for permission versus explaining ourselves out of character. Doing the latter starts to create assumptions. It becomes rationalizing and abstracting the story beat instead of giving time for the story to change. Play more, talk less, and be more trusting. "Play to find out." Peter and ADHD would benefit to just absorb what is going on. Have the capable wherewithal to recognize story beats while ALSO reaching those beats organically. The characters make the choices, not the player. Asking for permission ooc is like DMing a player and asking them to trust them mid-game.
Kayley as a player likes watching the players play and see where they end up as a result of their actions and trains of thought.

I personally like the idea of asking for permission at the table too. Kayley agrees. Play to find out.
When you say something and no one responses, you have this strange and sudden urge to defend yourself.

Cases have to hit a mark at the end of a session. Checkpoints. The ability to do things on the side between big cases. Don't rush a case, don't set limits. Let it feel natural. Let players figure it out. Let players hit whatever beats they want to and run with it.

Peter: On the topic of Matt Mercer. There are 4 hours sessions of shopping simulator. Players want to fuck around. That's okay!

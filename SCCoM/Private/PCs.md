# Moonshadow
Before their wook journey, Moonshadow Starship was a normal person. They lived a mundane life with a normal job, probably as a service worker. They're not sure what drove them to the beach to do shrooms, but it opened their eyes. Early on, Moonshadow had a bad trip. When they came to, Czhewy was there, and they stayed by Moonshadow's side ever since. It's been about 15 years since and now Moonshadow roams the town, eventually ending up at the beach where everyone waits to bear witness.

- Red stripes on the outside
### Czhewy - Bodyguard/Tripsitter/Second-in-command.

### John from Frezno - Homeless guy that grows mushrooms
- Moonshadow gives John from Frezno a place to stay
- John from Frezno is all about the business aspect, Moonshadow prefers to just spread the shrooms
- Penis envy?
### Featherz - Tent regular

### PC Relationships

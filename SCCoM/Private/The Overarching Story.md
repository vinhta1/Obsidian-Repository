"Before 1955, the Mist hadn't really settled in yet. It was there, but it was weak. You could call Santa Cruz the City of Rifts at the time. You won't find any remains of it now though. If not the Mist, Icarus made sure of that.
He was a kid when he found out he and his best friend had powers. Maybe they've always had them. Matching wings and everything. They did what any kid would do. They flew, as high as they could until they wanted to see the ground again or when they thought their parents would worry about them. Well, until Icarus's parents would worry about them.
Nerium's parents were taken to a camp when she was young. She would've been taken too, if Icarus's parents didn't mask her Japanese heritage as Chinese. So they grew up together underneath the same household. They got close. Maybe that closeness is why he killed her after what she did.
You see, Icarus and Nerium were special. They had matching mythos. They weren't the same, mind you, but they were directly connected. Archangels from biblical stories. And they weren't the only ones.

##### *Grim Reaper/Prosfair*
Looks like chess. No one knows the game, but everyone knows how to play.
Each move represents 1 hours and adds to the Complexity tag. For each tier, subtract one power from Go-toe-to-toe rolls.
Go-toe-to-toe results
- 10+: Checkmate status gains 1-tier. Represents one step closer to checkmating the Grim Reaper.
- 7-9: Nothing happens.
- 6-: Death status gains 1-tier. Represents one step closer to you getting checkmated.


When do the worst things in Santa Cruz happen?
At night, usually. When no one's around, when it's easy to get away with it.

Where do the worst things in Santa Cruz happen?
Somewhere secluded. The forest, the beach.

What other crimes happen?
As of September, many drug paraphernalia and public intoxication cases. Warrants for arrest, battery, vandalism. Few other ones like sex crimes and stalking. Most bad things that happen here are mundane. And thus crime must be kept mundane. The weird and the unbelievable will be the main big bad. The other main big bad, are all the things universal to everyone. The morals, the ethics, the bad of life, the good of life. All contained in a mostly quiet college town.


## The Drug Problem
A drug that gives people mist tolerance. Reduces protections. Might create rifts.
A cult leader trying to become something more than human. A new god.
The last member of a drug cartel trying to rebuild and revenge. A new player in town.
The small community trying to protect the city and the mist. Chinatown.

## The Industry Meat Grinder
A witch possessing people who visit Santa Cruz, trafficking them
A witch conning and trafficking sea creatures and mythological beasts
A company recruiting fresh grads into inescapable jobs
A company trying to expand, destroying the forest and urbanizing the city

## The War For Heaven
Chinatown wants to try to make heaven.
The greek mythology wants to make mount olympus and take over the ocean.
A cult wants to make heaven in santa cruz.

## The Story Within the Mundane
Rifts trying to learn how to control their powers.
People trying to get through life, normally.
Close friends dealing with heavy and light things. Strangers dealing with heavy and light things.
Small jobs, odd jobs, fun jobs.
The influence of avatars on the city, indirectly

THIS IS ALL SUBTEXT, JUST MAKE CASES WITH THIS IN MIND
And then make character specific cases with this in mind as well.
Icarus - Nero is alive
Jerri - Reginald is here
Danny - Her old gang is back and wants revenge.
Ewan - his parents have been possessed and forced to labor.
Moonshadow - his community is being taken advantage of

Where are the main areas? The main places? The spots to come back to? Why? There needs to be concrete locations. Think of games like Persona, Yakuza, or even GTA, where there is always a place to come back to, and a new place everyone once in a while.

Lemuria vs Atlantis? Lemuria and Atlantis? Some underwater realm
Lemuria, advanced humans. Tech-heavy and adapting the environment to sustain themselves and their society.
Swings:
- We must lead the world to a new evolution (Guide Humanity) vs. The people are undeserving of the technology they possess (Conquer Humanity)
- We can live among them, gently guiding them to something better (Return to the Surface) vs. Humans are a lost cause. Our world exists here, not there. (Deny the Surface)
Atlantis, merpeople. Coexisting with the environment and being one with the ocean.
Atlantis and Lemuria has had a long lasting, yet fragile truce. As the ocean heats up, Atlantis has found themselves needing more and more help from their Lemurian neighbors. Some Lemurians are welcoming. Most are fatigued and unsympathetic. However, deep below the waters lies an insidious plot to siege the City.

Maraket (Mara's Market, Mara Mart)
A night market that sprawls forever. Every time you look back the entrance and exit is just as close as you left it.
An infinite mall with sprawling and spiraling escalators.
Ads, ads everywhere.

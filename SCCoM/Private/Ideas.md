At night, usually. When no one's around, when it's easy to get away with it.

Where do the worst things in Santa Cruz happen?
Somewhere secluded. The forest, the beach.

What other crimes happen?
As of September, many drug paraphernalia and public intoxication cases. Warrants for arrest, battery, vandalism. Few other ones like sex crimes and stalking. Most bad things that happen here are mundane. And thus crime must be kept mundane. The weird and the unbelievable will be the main big bad. The other main big bad, are all the things universal to everyone. The morals, the ethics, the bad of life, the good of life. All contained in a mostly quiet college town.

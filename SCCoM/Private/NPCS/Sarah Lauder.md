# Jerri
Jerri is Sarah's former roommate from the first two years of college. They're in the same major and thus take similar if not the same classes. They've stayed close even though they don't live together anymore. Sarah tries to keep Jerri on track in her academic career, often reminding her to come to classes and to finish assignments.
Sarah now lives in the [[UC Santa Cruz Campus#[Sarah's Apartment](geo 36.98900480039999,-122.06290850046572)|campus apartments]].

#Case Groundhog Day, Endless Eight
# Background
It is April 29th. A teenage boy is suffering emotionally. He is on the precipice of letting go of whatever was ailing him. He gets the catharsis he longs for, before getting into a car accident right before midnight. It is April 30th. The loop starts.
A young boy explores the town and has fun while he can. His older brother lays in a hospital bed, and every time right before midnight, he dies. Then, the day repeats.
From what it seems, the day resets because the boy simply does not want it to end. He knows that when tomorrow comes his brother will be gone for good. He seems to be the only one that is aware of the time reset. However, the crew (and possibly other rifts) becomes aware over time after prolonged contact with the boy. Furthermore, the source of the loop might not be the boy at all. It might be the teenager who has given up on living who needs to be convinced to hold on. It might be both.

The themes of this case are:
- Moving on from something you're not ready to let go.
- A fantastical situation that cannot be solved using powers or mythos.
- Grief, loss, regret, and acceptance.

# Cold Open
"The moon glows bright over a lone vehicle rolling through Santa Cruz. A teenage boy cries in his car. The lighting eases into a red glare which pervades the pale light that once enveloped him as the car comes to a stop. He takes the time to calm down and stifle his tears, and he sits in the silence. The light turns green, and the car churns forward.
Tires skid. Plastic crumples plastic. Metal compresses metal. The cage rolls and sheds its skin along the asphalt. The teenager's hand hangs towards the ceiling, and the blood trickles upwards. Crimson fills the cracks on his watch, as it tick, tick, ticks.
Two seconds to midnight. One second to midnight."

# Investigation

##### At any location
- Random Events
	- Joanne, the worker/waitress, always wanted to become an actor. She bought a ticket for a plane to Hollywood but lost it the other day. It's in the left pocket of the cardigan with the flowers.
	- Martin, the regular, helps her find it after they spend a night together. In fact, they don't know that they both like each other until he mentions it.
	- Craig, the cranky old man, loves his grandkids and misses them dearly. The last time he saw them both was two years ago for Christmas dinner. He perks up when talking about them.
		- Maya is in college studying to be a Marine Biologist and Tim's in NYC managing a law firm. Tim's married (Polly) with his own kids (Paula, Pauline, and Paulina), and a dog (Phoebe).
	- A group of bullies (Jesse) is looking for Ewan and Phil warns Ewan to hide before he arrives. Jerri forgot about an assignment that's due tonight, but it's okay because you don't do it either way since Professor Deweese extends the deadline later tonight, but you really should because Icarus is behind on assignments and doesn't want to ask you for help.
		- They know a lot of personal information about the group, somehow. They don't say much since they get upset when they do.
	- A kid knocks over their food. People slip into each others' arms. A seagull steals someone's food. Someone wins a grand prize or celebrates something. A car nearly hits someone and slams the brakes, and as a result that car gets rear ended. 
- Doesn't actually know what the PCs will do. Has an idea, but it changes from time to time.
##### At The Wharf
- A kid dives into the water from the edge. Sometimes he comes back with someone unconscious. Sometimes he dies. Sometimes he doesn't dive at all.
- When asked about his knowledge, he responds with "Yeah, I'm a god." or "I just know." Sarcastic, avoidant.
##### At the Casino Arcade
- Someone has finally beat Ewan's high scores. It's the same kid each time. (PHL)
- In fact, he can beat anyone at any game there (except maybe Ewan).
##### From the kid, Phil Bell
- Extremely experienced and skilled, for someone his age. It's like he's tried everything.
- He knows the day is repeating. He doesn't mind having more time to do fun things,
- He doesn't want today to end, citing that it's the best day of his life.
- In actuality, he's hurting bad. His brother is in the hospital. He knows what will happen to him, but doesn't want to accept it.
##### At the teenager's, Connor Bell's, hospital room
- He has a small bonsai, with one branch untrimmed.
- He looks rough. He probably won't see tomorrow.
- His phone has a lot of people checking on him, asking if he's okay, well wishes, and promises to see him when he gets out.
##### From Connor Bell, if they somehow manage to communicate
- The teenager feels like they've been in a long dream.
- They're okay with dying. They await the peace it brings, and it seems like they've already obtained it since the car crash.
- But actually, they aren't at peace. There's so much they haven't done. They know what ever longs for darkness isn't him. He doesn't want to go.

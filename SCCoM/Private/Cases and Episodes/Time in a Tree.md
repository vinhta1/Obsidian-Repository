#Case Groundhog Day, Endless Eight
# Background
The day repeats. A young boy explores the town and has fun while he can. His older brother lays in a hospital bed, and every time right before midnight, he dies. Then, the day repeats again. From what it seems, the day resets because the boy simply does not want it to end. He knows that when tomorrow comes his brother will be gone for good.
The themes of this case are
- Moving on from something you're not ready to let go.
- A fantastical situation that cannot be solved using powers or mythos.
- Grief, loss, regret, and acceptance.

# Cold Open
"A teenage boy cries in his car. The moon glows bright over the lone vehicle rolling through Santa Cruz. It eases into a red glare which pervades the pale light that once hugged him. He takes the time to calm down and stifle his tears. He enjoys silence for the first time in a while. The light turns green, and the car churns forward.
Tires skid. Plastic crumples plastic. Metal compresses metal. The cage rolls and sheds its skin along the asphalt. The teenager's hand hangs towards the ceiling, and the blood trickles upwards. Crimson fills the cracks on his watch, as it tick, tick, ticks.
Two seconds to midnight. One second to midnight."

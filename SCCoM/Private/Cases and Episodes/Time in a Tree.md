#Case Groundhog Day, Endless Eight
# Background


# Cold Open
A man cries in his car. The moon glows bright over the lone vehicle rolling through Santa Cruz. It eases into a red glare which pervades the pale light that once hugged him. He takes the time to calm down and stifle his tears. He enjoys silence for the first time in a while. The light turns green, and the car churns forward.
Tires skid. Plastic crumples plastic. Metal compresses metal. The cage rolls and sheds its skin along the asphalt. The man's hand hangs towards the ceiling, and the blood trickles upwards. Crimson fills the cracks on his watch, as it tick, tick, ticks.
3 seconds to midnight. 2 seconds to midnight.

#Case Groundhog Day, Endless Eight
# Background
A man cries in his car. The moon glows bright over the lone vehicle rolling through Santa Cruz. It eases into a red glare which pervades the pale light that once hugged him. He takes the time to calm down and stifle his tears. He enjoys silence for the first time in a while. The light turns green, and the car churns forward.
Tires skid. Plastic crumples plastic. Metal compresses metal. The cage rolls and sheds its skin along the asphalt.

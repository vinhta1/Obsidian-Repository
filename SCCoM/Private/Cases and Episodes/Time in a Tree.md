#Case Groundhog Day, Endless Eight
# Background
A teenage boy is suffering emotionally. He is on the precipice of letting go of whatever was ailing him. He gets the catharsis he longs for, before getting into a car accident right before midnight. The loop starts.
The day repeats. A young boy explores the town and has fun while he can. His older brother lays in a hospital bed, and every time right before midnight, he dies. Then, the day repeats again. From what it seems, the day resets because the boy simply does not want it to end. He knows that when tomorrow comes his brother will be gone for good. He seems to be the only one that is aware of the time reset. However, the crew (and possibly other rifts) becomes aware over time after prolonged contact with the boy.

The themes of this case are:
- Moving on from something you're not ready to let go.
- A fantastical situation that cannot be solved using powers or mythos.
- Grief, loss, regret, and acceptance.

# Cold Open
"The moon glows bright over a lone vehicle rolling through Santa Cruz. A teenage boy cries in his car. The lighting eases into a red glare which pervades the pale light that once enveloped him as the car comes to a stop. He takes the time to calm down and stifle his tears, and he sits in the silence. The light turns green, and the car churns forward.
Tires skid. Plastic crumples plastic. Metal compresses metal. The cage rolls and sheds its skin along the asphalt. The teenager's hand hangs towards the ceiling, and the blood trickles upwards. Crimson fills the cracks on his watch, as it tick, tick, ticks.
Two seconds to midnight. One second to midnight."

# Investigation
##### At the Casino Arcade
- Someone has finally beat Ewan's high scores. It's the same kid each time.
- In fact, he can beat anyone at any game there (except maybe Ewan).

##### From the kid
- He knows the day is repeating.
- 
##### At the teenager's hospital room
- He has a small bonsai, with one branch untrimmed.
- He looks rough. He probably won't see tomorrow.

##### The teenager

#Case 
Willy Wonka is going to an island to collect more ingredients to make candies.
Indiana Jones, Scribblenauts, lots of traps, lots of room for imagination. The island is the enemy

Candy animals, insects, spiders, and plants that get bigger and more dangerous the closer the crew gets to rarer ingredients.

Extra-Fortified Sugar

# Notes
Things to stop Icarus from flying

# Background
**Old Man Marini (Willy Wonka)** is the owner of Marini's at the Beach. He likes to make new candies all the time. He's been working on a candy, a recreation of the everlasting gobstopper, the candy marble. Unfortunately, he is missing just one ingredient: **Extra-Fortified Sugar**. Thus, he must make a perilous trip to **Candy Island**.

There are a few unspoken rules of Candy Island. The wildlife are intelligent and are not to be harmed. Also, anyone who comes are intruders, and should not feel entitled to anything on the island. Take only what is needed, and nothing more. Candy Island is a dangerous and beautiful place, plan accordingly.

### Caramel Pools
- **Molten Geysers**: Hot caramel erupts in pillars. Add the *Molten Caramel* tag. Anyone who touches the Caramel takes *Burned-2*.
- The temple is easily spotted from the outskirts and within the area of the geysers. 
---
**In The Temple:**
- **False Paths**: There's a pool of caramel that needs to be crossed. Only one path is correct.
- **[[Old Man Marini and the Perilous Candy Island#Golden Slimes|Golden Slimes]]** constantly ooze from the walls and chase the player.
- **The warm key**. When taken, the temple will begin to flood.

### Golden Slimes
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 2
#### Moves
- **Collective**: This starts with a collective of 0. Whenever its spectrum is maxed, reset it to 0, reduce its max by 1, and increase the collective by 1. 
- --- 
- Merge with another slime, reducing its collective and increasing its spectrum max by 1.
- Cover someone in molten caramel, giving them *Burned-2*.
-  ---
- Jump towards someone.

### Cinnamon Desert
- **Spiced Sands**: The air is arid and the cinnamon makes it hard to breathe. Players may take a status of *Exhaustion-1* as a hard move while in the Cinnamon Desert.
- **The Worm**: There is a sandworm that traverses underneath the desert. It can be summoned, if the players wish to (they make up the method). The worm is the temple.
- ---
**In The Temple:**
- There is a liquid (worm water) that pools within the worm. It shimmers and looks refreshing. Drinking this feels hot running down, but cures all exhaustion status.
- The worm has a piece of flesh that dangles and drips with worm water. If agitated, the worm will exhale and thus free whoever is trapped inside. Of course, other methods exist as well.
- **The warm key**. When taken, nothing happens.
### Marshmallow Fields
- Warm Storm: Bright and thundering clouds that rain marshmallows swirl over the fields. It is warm. The smell of toasted marshmallow wafts from the distance as lightning strikes from place to place. If a player ever rolls snake eyes, lightning strikes on their position and adds a *Marshmallow Fire* tag.
- The winds blow the marshmallows against the temple, creating a sort of mound but not covering it. It is within the center of the storm, in the eye.
- - ---
**In The Temple:**
- There is a large chamber that is too deep to climb out of. Marshmallows trickle in, at a snail's pace, and fill the bottom. 
- At the bottom of the pit, is **the warm key**. When taken, lightning begins to strike. If the player does not act fast enough, they take *Electrocuted-4*. However, if the pit is filled with marshmallows, the temple is hit instead.

#Case 
Willy Wonka is going to an island to collect more ingredients to make candies.
Indiana Jones, Scribblenauts, lots of traps, lots of room for imagination. The island is the enemy

Candy animals, insects, spiders, and plants that get bigger and more dangerous the closer the crew gets to rarer ingredients.

Extra-Fortified Sugar

# Background
**Old Man Marini (Willy Wonka)** is the owner of Marini's at the Beach. He likes to make new candies all the time. He's been working on a candy, a recreation of the everlasting gobstopper, the candy marble. Unfortunately, he is missing just one ingredient: **Extra-Fortified Sugar**. Thus, he must make a perilous trip to **Candy Island**.

There are a few unspoken rules of Candy Island. The wildlife are intelligent and are not to be harmed. Also, anyone who comes are intruders, and should not feel entitled to anything on the island. Take only what is needed, and nothing more. Candy Island is a dangerous and beautiful place, plan accordingly.

### Caramel Pools
- **Molten Geysers**: Hot caramel erupts in pillars. Add the *Molten Caramel* tag. Anyone who touches the Caramel takes *Burned-2*.
- The temple is easily spotted from the outskirts and within the area of the geysers. 
---
**In The Temple:**
- **False Paths**: There's a pool of caramel that needs to be crossed. Only one path is correct.
- **[[Old Man Marini and the Perilous Candy Island#Golden Slimes|Golden Slimes]]** constantly ooze from the walls and chase the player.
- **The warm key**. When taken, the temple will begin to flood with caramel lava. A door will open which leads to a network of hallways.

### Golden Slimes
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 2
#### Moves
- **Collective**: This starts with a collective of 0. Whenever its spectrum is maxed, reset it to 0, reduce its max by 1, and increase the collective by 1. 
- --- 
- Merge with another slime, reducing its collective and increasing its spectrum max by 1.
- Cover someone in molten caramel, giving them *Burned-2*.
-  ---
- Jump towards someone.

### Cinnamon Desert
- **Spiced Sands**: The air is arid and the cinnamon makes it hard to breathe. Players may take a status of *Exhaustion-1* as a hard move while in the Cinnamon Desert.
- **The Worm**: There is a sandworm that traverses underneath the desert. It can be summoned, if the players wish to (they make up the method). The worm is the temple.
- ---
**In The Temple:**
- There is a liquid (worm water) that pools within the worm. It shimmers and looks refreshing. Drinking this feels hot running down, but cures all exhaustion status.
- The worm has a piece of flesh that dangles and drips with worm water. If agitated, the worm will exhale and thus free whoever is trapped inside. Of course, other methods exist as well.
- **The warm key**. When taken, nothing happens.
### Marshmallow Fields
- **Warm Storm**: Bright and thundering clouds that rain marshmallows swirl over the fields. It is warm. The smell of toasted marshmallow wafts from the distance as lightning strikes from place to place. If a player ever rolls snake eyes, lightning strikes on their position and adds a *Marshmallow Fire* tag.
- The winds blow the marshmallows against the temple, creating a sort of mound but not covering it. It is within the center of the storm, in the eye.
- - ---
**In The Temple:**
- There is a large chamber that is too deep to climb out of. Marshmallows trickle in, at a snail's pace, and fill the bottom. 
- At the bottom of the pit, is **the warm key**. When taken, lightning begins to strike. If the player does not act fast enough, they take *Electrocuted-4*. However, if the pit is filled with marshmallows, the temple is hit instead.
### Licorice Jungle
- **Twisted and Tangled**: It is incredibly hard to navigate through this jungle. Add a *Twisted Vines* tag.
- The temple is hidden deep in the Jungle. It will require a clue to find. 
- ---
**In The Temple:**
- Light fills a long corridor. Licorice is strung from one end to another. If any are touched, an axe will start to swing from the ceiling. There are three axes, each trying to inflict *Sliced-3*
- **The dark key.** When taken, the axes will stop swinging. The **[[Old Man Marini and the Perilous Candy Island#Licorice Snakes|licorice]]** that was cut will start to slither towards whoever took the key. The licorice snakes are now watching until they leave the jungle.

### Licorice Snakes
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 1
#### Moves
- The snakes are not active until **the dark key** is taken.
- **Collective**: This starts with a collective of 2.
- --- 
- *Bite-1* or *Choke-1*
-  ---
- Turn its head towards a character.
- Slither towards a character.

### Chocolate Canyon
- Despite its name, it's mostly a savanna with chocolate grass and trees that somehow survive the heat of the sun. The place is teeming with fauna. Some of them don't seem to eager to greet guests. Add the *Hostile Wildlife-2* status.
- A chocolate river has carved a canyon that has split the savanna in two. On a slowly eroding and melting platform within this canyon, the temple rests.
- ---
**In The Temple:**
- A lot of [[Old Man Marini and the Perilous Candy Island#Chocolate Wildlife|Hostile Wildlife]] (Collective 2).
- **The dark key**. When taken, add a tier to *Hostile-Wildlife*. Also, a chocolate truffle boulder starts to roll towards the characters. Add a *Chocolate Boulder* story tag.

### Chocolate Wildlife
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 3 | Intimidate or Soothe: 3
#### Moves
- **Collective**: This starts with a collective of 1.
- Kangaroos will try to fight physically. Spiders will try to bite. Vultures will hover and dive. If players stay away and or act friendly, they have a better chance of avoiding them. If the Hostile Wildlife status is removed, these dangers will not attack.
- --- 
- **Kangaroo Strike**: Inflict *Bruised-3*
- **Spider Lunge**: Inflict *Poisoned-2*
- **Vulture Swarm**: Increase the collective by 1 (another vulture). The next hard move may be a divebomb, inflicting *Clawed-2*.
-  ---
- Size up the characters.
- Hiss at the characters.
- Hover over the characters.
### Cream Hill Zone
- It's snowing over hills of ice cream. An absolutely wonderful place. Should have brought some snow shoes though. Add the *Soft Snow* tag.
- The temple of ice is found easily after passing over enough hills of ice cream.
- ---
**In the Temple:**
- It is vast, and looks like a palace. A family and their subjects could live here. However, it is empty and frigid.
- **The cold key.** It is encased in a block of ice. It can be melted with **the warm key,** among other ways.
### Candy Cane Caverns
- Unlike any other area, the entrance is a mouth of a giant cave that leads into a bright red and white mountain. It is minty and sharp, with stalactites and stalagmites throughout. The area echoes and is very claustrophobic. Add the *Sharp Edges* tag. This is the temple.
- ---
- Whenever a player makes a loud noise, stalactites will fall from the ceiling for *Cut-2* or *Impale-3*.
- Before **the cold key** which is illuminated by a single light, is a large gap that must be jumped across, with a beam hanging above it for a rope or something but too far to grab. Then, there is a thin bridge above a pit of candy cane spikes.
- When **the cold key** is retrieved, the stalactites start to fall until the players escape.

### The Hidden Castle
- This area is hidden until the three keys have been found. When found, fireworks and spotlights will start to pop into the sky, revealing The Hidden Castle. The keys form to make an envelope full of wedding invitations. These wedding invitations are in their "true" names.
- The castle, which once was overgrown and desolate, has found renewed beauty and vigor. The cotton candy cobwebs have been cleaned up and the castle is no longer infested. The denizens of the island have came together to partake in festivities and celebrate the wedding. Add the story tags, *A Day to Remember*, *Esteemed Guests*, *Festivities and Formalities*.

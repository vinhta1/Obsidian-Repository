#Case 
# Background
Corporations and franchises are thriving. Across the street from a chain store or restaurant lies an ashen corpse of a building: a mom and pop shop slumps in the blackened ruins of it former self. Periodically, an amber hue outshines the stars. The civilians remark the dark smoke that comes from Midtown and fills the blue sky. Local businesses are burning, and no one knows why. But everyone knows how.

A group of arsonists, known as Fireside, are targeting small businesses, and it's not at random. Select locations are chosen to make more room for bigger, more profitable, and more prolific storefronts and services. They love playing with fire, but they've forgotten what it's like to be burnt. Someone must've wanted to remind them.

A Fireside member's house was targeted. Fire, just like the other arsons. But this was someone's home. Jerri was there to save the woman and child trapped inside. But what if she wasn't?

Andrew Scott, owner of The Picnic Basket, along with some other business owners have decided to retaliate after hearing that a Fireside member's house was the target of arson. Armed with a list of locations and some gasoline, Fireside is going to burn.

# Investigation
##### The Picnic Basket: preplanning payback
- Jerri's List
	- It is a list of 4 addresses of local businesses and 4 alphanumeric character sequences.
	- The codes are passwords for authenticators, allowing access to hidden emails and messages.
		- The address corresponds with the person responsible for burning it. e.g. if Chris burnt the corner store, his password is next to the corner store's address.
- Andrew Scott's Map
	- There's a map with 5 locations circled. They believe that these places are where Fireside meets up and stores their equipment.
##### The New List:
- The New List contains the details and significance of 5 addresses.
- 3 of the addresses from the Map match up with the New List. 
	- 2 are Fireside hideouts. 1 is a Fireside member's home.
	- The other two from the Map are an innocent person's home and a building in construction. No clues can be found here.
	- The 4th address from the New List is a Black Company Front.
	- The 5th is the burned down home from earlier.
##### Pacific Ave, The Unfinished Station
##### 1111 Water Street. A Local Business, Hideout

#Case 
# Notes
Andrew is *fired-up-2* because of Nemesis. Andrew is not typically this angry or vengeful. There's someone that's trying to burn down a target as the Crew meets up at The Picnic Basket. If Andrew calls off the fire attack, the person's phone alerts Fireside and gets them discovered. Otherwise, the fire starts. Either way, they are caught.

What can Nemesis do?
"I just work at the boardwalk dude." -> Normal, discreet
A heart of anger. Hates bullies.
"Doesn't that piss you off?" -> A power to enrage people

Kenneth might want to talk to Ezra.

Andrew wants the crew to burn these five places down.
Phone has messages that clue into what might be Joe's code.
Local business member is torturing a auxiliary fireside member by splashing water on someone trapped in a walk-in cooler.

# Background
### Local Businesses Targeted
Across the street lies an ashen corpse of a building: a mom and pop shop by Bay Street, or maybe a hobby store just outside of downtown, slumps in the blackened ruins of it former self. Periodically, frequently, within the last month an amber hue would outshine the stars, or onlookers would remark the dark smoke that came from Midtown and filled the blue sky. Local businesses were burning. Local businesses are still burning.

A group of arsonists known as Fireside are targeting small businesses, and it's not at random. Select locations are chosen to make more room for bigger, more profitable, and more prolific storefronts and services. They love playing with fire, but they've forgotten what it's like to be burnt. They ought to remember now.

These aren't ghosts or monsters hiding in the closet. They're just people. They have lives, they have jobs, they even have homes and families. They have something to lose. Ever since that house fire, the arsons have been slowing down. Maybe we burn a few more houses down, it'll stop for good.

We have a handful of places that we suspect are housing Fireside. Maybe hideouts, meeting places. There's a few places in residential areas too. Some of the guys are keen against lighting those up but, I won't watch my friends' livelihoods go up in flames just for some sickos' entertainment. They want to play with fire? We can play with fire.
### Fireside
Ezra, Luca, Damon, and Joe are a couple of guys that grew up together in the same neighborhood. Ezra used to light fires, and the boys would watch. They became closer, but they grew older too. Their lives went on different routes. Ezra and Damon became criminals, while Luca and Joe lived ordinary lives.

Ezra's first arson was, coincidentally, an important Black Company property. That got him in a lot of trouble, but instead of draining him and his family of his life's earning and assets, they hired him so that he could repay his debt. Fireside started with one man who dug a hole he couldn't get himself out of, and desperate to get out, dragged his friends inside.

Ezra's last assignment is to burn buildings. Not one, not two, Ezra hires others to help him. He needs others to help him. The Company gave him an impossible task.

Fireside almost completed their mission, until one of them lost their house in a fire. Most of them left after convincing themselves that it was targeted and intentional. Still, they managed on their own. Five buildings left, only one night to do it. Except, for one hitch. Someone just tried to burn down Ezra's house.
### The Black Company
Burn down buildings in the shape of a pentagram. The Company is trying to experiment. Trying to create rifts. A buyer and investor (Reginald) wants a piece of that pie. "God or Satan, either will do." So, The Company is pulling a Hail Mary from the playbook.
The Black Company's trying to do something *big*. But first, they need their actors and props in place.
Fireside is a group of arsonists tasked to burn down multiple local businesses by The Black Company. That way, The Company can install their own storefronts there, or maybe even reimburse and rebuild the old stores. Each target is a point that when connected together on a map, it reveals a symbol: a pentagram.

### Nemesis

## Timeline
**Decades ago**: Ezra, Damon, Luca, and Joe become friends. The boys become enticed by fire, but Ezra becomes enamored.
**Years after**: They all grow older. Ezra and Damon become career criminals while Luca and Joe stay in civilian life.
**A couple years ago**: Ezra gets a job to burn down a building. He finds out the morning after that it belonged to The Black Company.
**A year ago**: Ezra is half way through paying off his debt.
**A couple months ago**: The Company gives him an impossible job: burn down dozens of buildings within a single month. Ezra calls his old friends.
**A month ago**: Fireside debuts, and the arsons begin.
**A couple of weeks ago**: The cornerstore by the laundromat in midtown is burned down. The Fireside calling card is found, same as the other arsons on the news. That night, a Fireside member's home is burned down. His family was inside, but is saved.
**The days after that**: Two police detectives die investigating the Fireside house after a firetrap kills them. Furthermore, inspired by the person who burnt down the Fireside house, local business owners retaliate, finding and identifying Fireside members and attacking them. With the police effort heavily increased and the threat of their personal lives being targeted, much of Fireside is either caught or disbanded. 
**Yesterday**: Ezra's family is kidnapped while he tries to get gas and bottles. A small business card, much like the Fireside cards, is left behind. Andrew Scott, owner of The Picnic Basket, kidnaps a Fireside member. He interrogates them for information, and gets five addresses.
**Tonight**: Ezra has one last night to burn down four more buildings before his family disappears. The local businesses plan on delivering a final act of payback: burning down five fireside hideouts and homes in one night. Someone gets caught.
# Cold Open
"Today, we mourn the loss of two police officers." You see two men standing next to each other from an image of a group photo. One grins brightly, with dark hair swept to the side, hanging past their temple. The other man beside him, bald with even darker skin, smirks with an arm around his shoulder. "Detective Daz Lemon and Steven Lace lost their lives six days ago to a firebomb, left behind from yet another attack from the notorious Fireside group-" The camera cuts to a framed picture, the same one on the television screen, standing proudly on a living room cabinet. "-which took the home and nearly the lives of the Quijada family."

The news transitions to footage of that night. A woman is sobbing, trying to muster Spanish past a waterfall of tears and smoked lungs in front of the home, blazing red in the dark night. "This home was the latest target of Fireside, but will it be their last?"

The TV turns off. A man is sitting laidback on a couch. There are two young girls sleeping soundly next to him. The room is now dark, it's former light extinguished by the push of a remote. He slowly picks up the one leaning on him, so as to not wake her up. He walks up the stairs. You hear a soft grunt from outside and the shattering of glass, followed by a warm light.
# Investigation
There are three groups of addresses.
Jerri's List: found from Angel's house.
Andrew's Map: contains potential hideouts. None of the addresses match up with Jerri's List.
Fireside's Operations: matches with some of the addresses from Andrew's Map.
### The Lists
##### Jerri's List
- It is a list of 5 addresses of local businesses and 5 alphanumeric character sequences.
	- Cornerstore in Eastside (TR), Wellness with Gillie at the bottom of Seabright (BR), 515 Kitchen and Cocktails (TL), Picnic Basket at the Boardwalk (BL), Marianne's Ice Cream (T)
	- You can trace a star with the 5 locations. If tracing all the arson locations, it creates a pentagram.
	- The code is a password. Using the code will send someone out to confirm.
##### Andrew Scott's Map
- There's a map with 5 locations circled (Water St Shop, Berkeley Way House, Cleveland Ave House, Cedar St Restaurant, Pacific Ave Station). They believe that these places are where Fireside meets up and stores their equipment.
	- Cleveland Ave House is crossed out. Someone (Vince) has already been chosen and sent to burn it.
##### Blackjack
- These 5 addresses on Jerri's List are the LAST 5 addresses.
- Once a code has been entered, an auditor will be sent to check if the target was properly burned.
- Once all targets are burnt, money will be sent to whoever was on the payroll.
### Scenes
##### The Picnic Basket
- Andrew has a map of Santa Cruz with 5 locations circled: Cleveland Ave, Pacific Ave, Cedar St, Water St,  and Berkeley Way
	- "We're burning these down tonight."
- There is a suspicious van parked in front of the picnic basket. It is rigged with explosives. It will blow up when Damon chooses.
- Andrew is torturing someone in the cooler. It's a Fireside member.
	- He's the one that gave the locations.
	- Fireside's doing it for money. He knows about the main members and a little bit about what their deals are.
#### Possible Fireside Hideouts
##### At the House on Cleveland Ave, Chains' Home
- Vince just tried to light this place on fire a little too early. He is caught.
- Chains is the only one awake. His kids are asleep. Expect a talk.
##### Pacific Ave Construction Site, Hideout 1
- Damon is violently interrogating Vince. Expect a fight.
- Damon will use Vince or The Picnic Basket as leverage.
##### At the Renovating Restaurant on Cedar St, Hideout 3
- If they visit this place first, they will find Luca and Joe preparing to burn it down. Expect a talk.
- Otherwise, it is too late and the place is ablaze. No clues.
##### At the Shop on Water St, Hideout 2
- Joe has left his phone here. He and Luca will show up AFTER burning Cedar St Restaurant. Expect a talk.
- The phone, or any Fireside phone, can be used with the codes from Jerri's list start an inspection. If all 5 sites are cleared, Ezra's family is released and Ezra's debt is settled.
##### At the House on Berkeley Way, Ezra's Home/Hideout 3
- This home has been broken into an ransacked. Ezra's family lives here. They are no where to be found.
- A card that reads: DEADLINE - \[Date of Tonight] 11:59PM .
#### The Last Four Targets
- After all targets are burnt, return to hideout. If hideout is compromised, go to next hideout.
- If these aren't burnt by tonight, Ezra and his family is gone.
##### Wellness with Gillie
- Ezra's target. First burnt via molotov before heading to Marianne's Ice Cream.
##### 515 Kitchen and Cocktails
- Joe's target. First burnt before heading to Marianne's Ice Cream
##### The Picnic Basket
- Damon's target. Burnt via rigged van parked in front, remote detonated.
##### Marianne's Ice Cream
- Luca's target. Burnt via jerry cans after Joe's target is burnt. Might be burnt by Ezra instead.
# Checkpoints
Whenever an NPC is caught or a Fireside member is found/defeated, basically a transition between scenes, that can be a good stopping point. There's also some dramatic points. e.g. Picnic Basket blows up, Vince is caught, Ezra's extortion is found, etc.
# Case End
- Did you find the man in the cooler?
- Did you find out who Ezra was hired by?
- Did Ezra's family survive? Did Fireside suffer any (more) casualties?
- What happened with Chains?
- Were you able to save any of the local businesses?
# Dangers
### Fireside
#### Spectrums
Disband 3 | Turn: - | Convince or-Threaten: 3 | Beat-or-Subdue: 3
#### Moves
- **Team**: Fireside consists of four different distinct members and takes statuses separately. When a team member is overcome, or captured, give the team a disband status with a tier greater by one than it has now. When a team member is retrieved, decrease the disband tier by one.
- Targeting a specific member may have different results.
	- **Ezra and Damon** have (*guns*). When they take a physical harm or subdue status, reduce it by 1. Ezra can light a (*firebomb*) as a soft move.
	- **Luca and Joe** have (*morals*). Luca can give (*distracted-2*) as a hard move and Joe can give a *clue* once as an intrusion. Joe has a bomb vest underneath his coat, provided by Damon. No one else knows or approves at ALL.
- **Make it Personal**: When mentioning their real lives, they immediately gain a tier-2 status reflecting their reaction.
---
- Light it up (Burn a *firebomb* tag to *light-em-up-3* and create a *fire patch* tag OR **Make Something Terrible Happen**).
- Damon: "I do this for a living" (*Execute-5*, *Clean-Shot-4* OR **Make Something Terrible Happen**)
- Joe: "I just want to do something right" (*Fatal-explosion-5*)
- Fists and whatever else (*bruised-2*, *subdue-2*, or *shot-3*).
- One of them gets away (**Deny Them Something They Want**).
- Talk it out (*compromise-2* or *sympathy-2*).
---
- Brandish/aim a gun or threaten someone/to burn something.
- Damon: Threaten to kill Vince or blow up The Picnic Basket.
- Joe: Reveal the bomb vest.
- Rush someone.
- Call out a target.
- "Let's get out of here, now!"
- Reveal their nature: Ezra is desperate and is the leader. Damon is greedy and dangerous. Luca is rational and friendly. Joe is a klutz, but loyal.

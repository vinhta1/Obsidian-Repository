#Case 
# Background
Corporations and franchises are thriving. Across the street from a chain store or restaurant lies the ashen corpse: A mom and pop shop slumps in the blackened ruins of it former self. Periodically, an amber hue outshines the stars. The civilians remark the dark smoke that comes from Midtown and fills the blue sky. Local businesses are burning, and no one knows why. But everyone knows how.

A group of arsonists, known as Fireside, are targeting small businesses. Its not at random. Select locations are chosen to make more room for bigger, more profitable and more prolific storefronts and services.

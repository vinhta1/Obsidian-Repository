#Case 
# Background
Corporations and franchises are thriving. Across the street from a chain store or restaurant lies the ashen corpse: A mom and pop shop slumps in the blackened ruins of it former self. Periodically, an amber hue outshines the stars. The civilians remark the dark smoke that comes from Midtown and fills the blue sky. Local businesses are burning, and no one knows why. But everyone knows how.

A group of arsonists, known as Fireside, are targeting small businesses, and it's not at random. Select locations are chosen to make more room for bigger, more profitable, and more prolific storefronts and services. They love playing with fire. They forgotten what it's like to be burnt.

A Fireside member's house was targeted.  Fire, just like the other arsons. But this was someone's home. Jerri was there to save the woman and child trapped inside. But what if she wasn't?

Andrew Scott, owner of the Picnic Basket, along with some other business owners have decided to retaliate. Armed with a list of locations and some gasoline, Fireside is going to burn.

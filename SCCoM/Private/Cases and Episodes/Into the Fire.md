#Case 
# Notes
Andrew is *fired-up-2* because of Nemesis. Andrew is not typically this angry or vengeful. There's someone that's trying to burn down a target as the Crew meets up at The Picnic Basket. If Andrew calls off the fire attack, the person's phone alerts Fireside and gets them discovered. Otherwise, the fire starts. Either way, they are caught.

What can Nemesis do?
"I just work at the boardwalk dude." -> Normal, discreet
A heart of anger. Hates bullies.
"Doesn't that piss you off?" -> A power to enrage people

Kenneth might want to talk to Ezra.
# Background
### Local Businesses Targeted
Corporations and franchises are thriving. Across the street from a chain or a restaurant lies an ashen corpse of a building: a mom and pop shop by Bay Street, or maybe a hobby store just outside of downtown, slumps in the blackened ruins of it former self. Periodically, frequently, within the last month an amber hue would outshine the stars, or onlookers would remark the dark smoke that came from Midtown and filled the blue sky. Local businesses were burning. Local businesses are still burning.

A group of arsonists known as Fireside are targeting small businesses, and it's not at random. Select locations are chosen to make more room for bigger, more profitable, and more prolific storefronts and services. They love playing with fire, but they've forgotten what it's like to be burnt. They ought to remember now.

These aren't ghosts or monsters hiding in the closet. They're just people. They have lives, they have jobs, they even have homes and families. They have something to lose. Ever since that house fire, the arsons have been slowing down. Maybe we burn a few more houses down, it'll stop for good.

We have a handful of places that we suspect are housing Fireside. Maybe hideouts, meeting places. There's a few places in residential areas too. Some of the guys are keen against lighting those up but, I won't watch my friends' livelihoods go up in flames just for some sickos' entertainment. They want to play with fire? We can play with fire.
### Fireside
Ezra, Luca, Damon, and Joe are a couple of guys that grew up together in the same neighborhood. Ezra used to light fires, and the boys would watch. They became closer, but they grew older too. Their lives went on different routes. Ezra and Damon became criminals, while Luca and Joe lived ordinary lives.

Ezra's first arson was, coincidentally, an important Black Company property. That got him in a lot of trouble, but instead of draining him and his family of his life's earning and assets, they hired him so that he could repay his debt. Fireside started with one man who dug a hole he couldn't get himself out of, and desperate to get out, dragged his friends inside.

Ezra's last assignment is to burn buildings. Not one, not two, Ezra hires others to help him. He needs others to help him. The Company gave him an impossible task.

Fireside almost completed their mission, until one of them lost their house in a fire. Most of them left after convincing themselves that it was targeted and intentional. Still, they managed on their own. Five buildings left, only one night to do it. Except, for one hitch. Someone just tried to burn down Ezra's house.
### The Black Company
Burn down buildings in the shape of a pentagram. The Company is trying to experiment. Trying to create rifts. A buyer and investor (Reginald) wants a piece of that pie. "God or Satan, either will do." So, The Company is pulling a Hail Mary from the playbook.
The Black Company's trying to do something *big*. But first, they need their actors and props in place.
Fireside is a group of arsonists tasked to burn down multiple local businesses by The Black Company. That way, The Company can install their own storefronts there, or maybe even reimburse and rebuild the old stores. Each target is a point that when connected together on a map, it reveals a symbol: a pentagram.

### Nemesis
# Cold Open
"Today, we mourn the loss of two police officers." You see two men standing next to each other from an image of a group photo. One grins brightly, with dark hair swept to the side, hanging past their temple. The other man beside him, bald with even darker skin, smirks with an arm around his shoulder. "Detective Daz Lemon and Steven Lace lost their lives six days ago to a firebomb, left behind from yet another attack from the notorious Fireside group-" The camera cuts to a framed picture, the same one on the television screen, standing proudly on a living room cabinet. "-which took the home and nearly the lives of the Quijada family."

The news transitions to footage of that night. A woman is sobbing, trying to muster Spanish past a waterfall of tears and smoked lungs in front of the ashes of her former home. The captions read: 'I wish I could tell you directly. Thank you. Thank you so much.'

The TV turns off. A man is sitting laidback on a couch. There are two young girls sleeping soundly next to him. The room is now dark, it's former light extinguished by the push of a remote. He slowly picks up the one leaning on him, so as to not wake her up, and takes her to her room. He comes back down and lifts the other girl into his arms.

He closes the door to the other bedroom. It couldn't be any more different from her sister's. He walks down the hallway, missing the slightly first girl's slightly ajar door. You hear the sound of chains.
# Investigation
There are three groups of addresses.
Jerri's List: found from Angel's house.
Andrew's Map: contains potential hideouts. None of the addresses match up with Jerri's List.
Fireside's Operations: matches with some of the addresses from Andrew's Map.
#### The Lists
##### Jerri's List
- It is a list of 5 addresses of local businesses and 5 alphanumeric character sequences.
- The codes are passwords for authenticators, allowing access to hidden emails and messages.
	- The address corresponds with the person responsible for burning it. e.g. Angel burnt the corner store, his password is next to the corner store's address. Thus, the codes are also a way to confirm a target's been hit.
##### Andrew Scott's Map
- There's a map with 5 locations circled. They believe that these places are where Fireside meets up and stores their equipment.
	- Only three of them are correct. Chains can lead them to one of them, if asked or even if he feels like he should.
- Two from the Map are an innocent person's home and a building in construction. No clues can be found here. Andrew and crew don't know this to start.
	- Letting them burn these places down will be heavy.
##### The New List
- The New List contains the details and significance of 5 addresses.
- 3 of the addresses from the Map match up with the New List. 
	- 2 are Fireside hideouts (Fireplace and Hot Tubs, The Unfinished Station). 1 is a Fireside member's home (Berkeley Way).
	- The 4th is the burned down home from earlier (Angel's home).
	-  The 5th address from the New List is a Black Company Front.
#### Scenes
##### The Picnic Basket


##### 1111 Water Street, Santa Cruz Fireplace and Hot Tubs
You can see the store lights are fully lit from a mile away. Every jacuzzi and stone hearth beyond the showroom windows is on opulent display. From a quick glance, you can't see anyone inside.
- **As you approach the doors and windows**: you notice a smoothly plastered sticker. It is alarmed.
- **As you move towards the back**: There is a fence gate with a latch. Once inside, you see that it is a mostly empty yard. You see firewood, chopped and placed into a stack that lines a wall. You also see a *ladder*, resting on the ground.
- **Inside the store**:
	- There is an active alarm system. If any of the stickered doors or windows were breached, the alarm is activated. It is sending a notification somewhere. **If Joe has his phone**, this alerts Fireside (*Fireside-alerted-1*).
	- Joeâ€™s phone was left behind on a counter.
		- Can be unlocked via passcode or FaceID. After three failed passcode attempts, the phone is locked out. (*Lockout-5*)
		- This phone, and every member of Fireside's phone, has an app: Blackjack. It looks like a common game app. It has one notification. Each member has their own unique authentication code that is used to unlock this app.
			- These codes align with Jerri's list. If you know the person's target, you will have their code. Joe's Blackjack needs Joe's code.
##### 319 Berkeley Way, The Fireside House
- Ezra's family lives here. They're oblivious.
- Ezra wants to take his family out of Santa Cruz. But first, he has to pay some debts. He owes the very people that put him on the job. Simply put, he can't say no.
##### 143 Chestnut St, The Innocent Apartment
- There's a neighbor who knew Angel. They visit each other from time to time.
##### 515 Cedar Street, The Unfinished Restaurant
- There is nothing here.
##### Pacific Ave, The Unfinished Station
Pillars and ramps of concrete and rebar create an echo chamber for deals in the dark. Not hidden in the slightest, except for how inconspicuous it is. No one cares to inspect yet another construction site in Santa Cruz. The shadows run deep enough to hide whatever, or whoever, might be waiting inside.
- **As you approach closer into the site**: you hear two things. (*Echoes - 2*)
	- If *Fireside isn't alerted*, you hear a smattering of voices conversing. The space makes it hard to comprehend what they are saying from this distance. You can't see them at all.
	- You hear your footsteps start to echo. They don't seem to hear it. Yet.
- **If you get even closer without alerting them**:
	- Someone is paying them to do this.
		- "We need to stop while we're ahead. Angel's family (Stephanie and Giselle) almost got razed with his house."
		- "If we finish this job, we get the original pay split among just us four. That's four times the original cut, fellas."
		- "C'mon, Ezra-"
		- "ONE. HUNDRED. THOUSAND. EACH. I can't do this without you guys. I'm not going to force you to. But get REAL. We need this money."
	- Phones are important. They contain hideout sites (The New List).
		- "Everyone know where the next 'hot spot' is?"
		- "Hey, uhh... about that."
		- "What Joe? Do you not know where to meet up?"
		- "No, I do. But I... I think I left my phone at the other hideout."
		- "...Don't worry about it. We can grab it tonight after we burn our target."
		- "That... that works. Thanks, Luca."

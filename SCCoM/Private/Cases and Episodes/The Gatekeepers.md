#Case Follow-up to Phil and Connor?

Operative Bianca Accardi and Operative Huyen Le are looking for a young girl to bring her back home to New Chinatown. This young girl, Ashley, is actually a ghost. Visible to rifts, she just looks like another ordinary girl. When she's had a good day, she'll be ready to go back. The operatives act normal, and are not hostile at all. In fact, they want Ashley to have a good time before bringing her back.

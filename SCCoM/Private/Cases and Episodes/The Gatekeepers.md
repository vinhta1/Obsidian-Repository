#Case Follow-up to Phil and Connor?

Operative Bianca Accardi and Operative Huyen Le are looking for a young girl to bring her back home to New Chinatown. This young girl, Ashley, is actually a ghost. Visible to rifts, she just looks like another ordinary girl. When she's had a good day, she'll be ready to go back. The operatives act normal, and are not hostile at all. In fact, they want Ashley to have a good time before bringing her back.
# Dangers
### Operative Bianca Accardi
### Operative Huyen Le (PAC Veiler 273)
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 3 | DMO The Scene: X
#### Moves
- **Not My First Rodeo**: When Huyen enters the scene, give her *alert-1* and *ready-for-anything-1*. She can renew these statuses as a hard move.
- **Nothing to See Here**: Set the *DMO-the-scene* spectrum maximum based on the difficulty of Huyen's task. When *DMO-the-scene* maxes out, everyone at the scene takes *oblivious-5* and all Mythos powers not actively sustained shut down (burn tags as necessary).
- **Greywasher**: Increase the effects of Huyen's Shrouding moves by one when targeting Conjurations or any ongoing Mythos power detached from its Rift.
- **Defensive Shrouding**: Once per scene, Huyen can use her Shrouding hard move as an intrusion.
- ---
- Reassure everyone at the scene (*calm-3* or remove up to 3 tiers of emotional statuses).

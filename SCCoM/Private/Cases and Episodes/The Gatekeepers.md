#Case Follow-up to Phil and Connor?

Operative Bianca Accardi and Operative Huyen Le are looking for a young girl to bring her back home to New Chinatown. This young girl, Ashley, is actually a ghost. Visible to rifts, she just looks like another ordinary girl. When she's had a good day, she'll be ready to go back. The operatives act normal, and are not hostile at all. In fact, they want Ashley to have a good time before bringing her back.
### Ashley's Goals
- Go somewhere she's never been before
- Do something she's never done before
- Have something she's never had before
- See something she's never seen before
- Overall just have a good time
# Dangers
### Operative Bianca Accardi (Rift Handler 274)
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 4 | Unmask: 6
#### Moves
- **Read the Sitch**: When the Rift Handler enters the scene, give her a status that would best serve her socially such as *seductive-2*, *impressive-2*, *woman-with-a-plan-2*, *here-to-help-2*, *stern-2*, etc.
- **Seasoned Negotiator**: When you **Convince** Bianca, reduce the tier of the status you give by two. When the Rift Handler makes you a good offer and you refuse, you are **Taking the Risk**.
- **Good Judge of Character**: As a soft move 

### Operative Huyen Le (PAC Veiler 273)
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 3 | DMO The Scene: X
#### Moves
- **Not My First Rodeo**: When Huyen enters the scene, give her *alert-1* and *ready-for-anything-1*. She can renew these statuses as a hard move.
- **Nothing to See Here**: Set the *DMO-the-scene* spectrum maximum based on the difficulty of Huyen's task. When *DMO-the-scene* maxes out, everyone at the scene takes *oblivious-5* and all Mythos powers not actively sustained shut down (burn tags as necessary).
- **Greywasher**: Increase the effects of Huyen's Shrouding moves by one when targeting Conjurations or any ongoing Mythos power detached from its Rift.
- **Defensive Shrouding**: Once per scene, Huyen can use her Shrouding hard move as an intrusion.
- ---
- Reassure everyone at the scene (*calm-3* or remove up to 3 tiers of emotional statuses).
- Distract-Mask-Obliviate witnesses at the scene, as per protocol (*amnesia-4*, or *DMO-1* for the entire scene).
- Shroud to protect herself from Mythos powers (burn up to two Mythos tags)
- Deploy a portable Mist Beacon (create Danger: Mist Beacon 277)
- Set up a Greywashing barrier (once per scene, create a new Danger: Grreywashing Barrier; for each point of size factor a PAC Veiler team has, it can increawse the barrier's size factor or *penetrate* spectrum maximum by 1)
- ---
- Step into a scene affected by a Rift as if nothing is out of the ordinary.
- Talk to witnesses casually (just before obliviating them).

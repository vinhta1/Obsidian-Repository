#Case Follow-up to Phil and Connor?

# Background
Operative Bianca Accardi and Operative Huyen Le are looking for a young girl to bring her back home to New Chinatown. This young girl, Ashley, is actually a ghost. Visible to rifts, she just looks like another ordinary girl. When she's had a good day, she'll be ready to go back. The operatives act normal, and are not hostile at all. In fact, they want Ashley to have a good time before bringing her back.
# Ashley's Goals
- Go somewhere she's never been before
- Do something she's never done before
- Have something she's never had before
- See something she's never seen before
- Overall just have a good day

# Investigation
**Asking Bianca and Huyen**
- Bianca and Huyen are highly secretive about their real identities as Gatekeepers
- Bianca and Huyen will say they're her foster parents and legal guardians, before saying that they are rifts devoted to guiding spirits stuck in the mortal world.
- They both have Jade bracelets. Huyen carries a duffle bag.
# Complications
If things get out of hand, the Gatekeepers will call Operative Nero, Icarus's handler, onto the scene.
# Dangers
### Ashley
Hungry Ghost
#### Spectrums
One Good Day: 4 | Banish: 1
#### Moves
- **Here For a Good Time**: Whenever Ashley accomplishes one of her goals or overall has a good time, increase her *one-good-day* status by 1. When it maxes out, she is ready to go home.
- ---
- #### Ashley's Goals
	- Go somewhere she's never been before
	- Do something she's never done before
	- Have something she's never had before
	- See something she's never seen before
	- Overall just have a good day
### Operative Bianca Accardi
(Rift Handler 274)
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 4 | Unmask: 6
#### Moves
- **Read the Sitch**: When Bianca enters the scene, give her a status that would best serve her socially such as *seductive-2*, *impressive-2*, *woman-with-a-plan-2*, *here-to-help-2*, *stern-2*, etc.
- **Seasoned Negotiator**: When you **Convince** Bianca, reduce the tier of the status you give by two. When the Rift Handler makes you a good offer and you refuse, you are **Taking the Risk**.
- **Good Judge of Character**: As a soft move, one player whose character is present reads out their Identities and Mysteries. Bianca knows or senses one of them.
- **Not My First Rodeo**: When Bianca enters the scene, give her *alert-2* and *ready-for-anything-2*. Bianca can renew these statuses as a hard move.
- **Defensive Shrouding**: Once per scene, Bianca can use her Shrouding hard moves as an intrusion.
- ---
- Convince someone to cooperate, using the best approach to sway them (*convinced-3*).
- Deduce an important fact about the person or social situation she's in (**Complicate Things, Bigtime**, or burn up to two **Convince** leverage tags).
- Cause the environment to hush when she or her allies are talking (*all-eyes-on-me-2*) or increase background distraction when her opponents speak (give the audience a temporary *scattered-attention-2*).
- Obliviate a room (*amnesia-4* to all present) or counter Mythos powers with Shrouding (burn up to 2 Mythos tags).
- ---
- Loom out of the crowd or a dark corner unexpectedly and introduce herself, holding out a calling card.
- Look a Rift up and down, gauging them.
- Approach a Rift with an offer that will serve both parties.

### Operative Huyen Le
(PAC Veiler 273)
#### Spectrums
Hurt or Subdue: 3 | DMO The Scene: X
#### Moves
- **Not My First Rodeo**: When Huyen enters the scene, give her *alert-1* and *ready-for-anything-1*. She can renew these statuses as a hard move.
- **Nothing to See Here**: Set the *DMO-the-scene* spectrum maximum based on the difficulty of Huyen's task. When *DMO-the-scene* maxes out, everyone at the scene takes *oblivious-5* and all Mythos powers not actively sustained shut down (burn tags as necessary).
- **Greywasher**: Increase the effects of Huyen's Shrouding moves by one when targeting Conjurations or any ongoing Mythos power detached from its Rift.
- **Defensive Shrouding**: Once per scene, Huyen can use her Shrouding hard move as an intrusion.
- ---
- Reassure everyone at the scene (*calm-3* or remove up to 3 tiers of emotional statuses).
- Distract-Mask-Obliviate witnesses at the scene, as per protocol (*amnesia-4*, or *DMO-1* for the entire scene).
- Shroud to protect herself from Mythos powers (burn up to two Mythos tags)
- Deploy a portable Mist Beacon (create Danger: Mist Beacon 277)
- Set up a Greywashing barrier (once per scene, create a new Danger: Grreywashing Barrier; for each point of size factor a PAC Veiler team has, it can increawse the barrier's size factor or *penetrate* spectrum maximum by 1)
- ---
- Step into a scene affected by a Rift as if nothing is out of the ordinary.
- Talk to witnesses casually (just before obliviating them).

Scenes
A host of spirits, described by Pailey, surround a cursed item. When someone touches it, they hear a faint voice that asks, "Would you like a friend?" If they turn around, their body disappears and the object returns to the podium. They are now in the spirit realm.

Huyen reaches into her fanny pack for her phone to grab a portable charger. She looks puzzled, as she reaches in. "Would I like a what, Bianca?" Bianca turns around to answer. "I didn't say anything. Huyen?" She is completely gone.

A withered yellow rose that is alive in spirit. Whoever touches will hear a voice ask "Would you like a friend?" Acknowledging that voice in anyway will transport them into the spirit realm.

A kitsune is in the living world. To live normally, it abducts people into the spirit realm, transforming into them, and then living their lives out as them.

A young man (Mars "Kit" Kittleman) is asleep in a bed, hooked to wires and tubes. He is in his room, guarded by men who patrol the hallways and outskirts of their nice home. Next to him is an arrangement of yellow roses, one of which is withered. The room in the physical world is luxurious, modern, and large. The grey linen curtains darken the wood slat and marble walls. The room in the spiritual world is a large garden, where he is surrounded by other spirits. He is having tea with them.

# Investigation
##### At Sun's Zoo
Along Highway 1, beyond the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk, past downtown and the college campuses, tucked and hidden between the preserves, the parks, and the ranches, is a zoo. Sun, what exhibit is everyone currently looking at right now?

##### At the House on the Hills
Up towards the base of the school are these nice houses. They're new, they're expensive.

##### In Kit's Room
Physical: The room is luxurious, modern, and large. The grey linen curtains darken the wood slat and marble walls. Like a picture you'd find in a magazine trying to sell you upscale furniture or a thread of rooms you'd want to live in. A young man in his 20s is asleep in his bed, hooked to wires and tubes. A rhythm of beats bounce around the walls. On the other side of the bed away from the monitors is a vase of yellow roses. One of them is withered.

Spiritual: You enter a large garden. Hedges guide you towards stone steps and trimmed green arches. The sky is blue and the clouds are white. There are yellow roses everywhere. Eventually you stumble upon a gazebo where a young man enjoys a cup of tea

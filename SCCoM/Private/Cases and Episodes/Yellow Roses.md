Scenes
A host of spirits, described by Pailey, surround a cursed item. When someone touches it, they hear a faint voice that asks, "Would you like a friend?" If they turn around, their body disappears and the object returns to the podium. They are now in the spirit realm.

Huyen reaches into her fanny pack for her phone to grab a portable charger. She looks puzzled, as she reaches in. "Would I like a what, Bianca?" Bianca turns around to answer. "I didn't say anything. Huyen?" She is completely gone.

A withered yellow rose that is alive in spirit. Whoever touches will hear a voice ask "Would you like a friend?" Acknowledging that voice in anyway will transport them into the spirit realm.

A kitsune is in the living world. To live normally, it abducts people into the spirit realm, transforming into them, and then living their lives out as them.

A young adult (Mars "Kit" Kittleman) is asleep in a bed, hooked to wires and tubes. He is in his room, guarded by men who patrol the hallways and outskirts of their nice home. Next to him is an arrangement of yellow roses, one of which is withered. The room in the physical world is luxurious, modern, and large. The grey linen curtains darken the wood slat and marble walls. The room in the spiritual world is a large field, where he is surrounded by other spirits. He is having tea with them.

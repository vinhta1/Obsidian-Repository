#Case 
Notes
Stories give things meaning. Meaning gives things power. That's how this city operates.
Belief does so much towards that, but every story is waiting to become real. Even the tiniest of legends are waiting for their time.
Closet door is a gateway. Jin can sense it as he gets closer, but everyone can see it
I don't want to be a malevolent being. But maybe that's just who I am. Maybe that's why I'm the way I am.
Which version of you are you?
You know we're supposed to be enemies right? Everything we do is to keep you down.

Scenes
A host of spirits, described by Pailey, surround a cursed item. When someone touches it, they hear a faint voice that asks, "Would you like a friend?" If they turn around, their body disappears and the object returns to the podium. They are now in the spirit realm.

Huyen reaches into her fanny pack for her phone. She looks puzzled, as she reaches in. "Would I like a what, Bianca?" Bianca turns around to answer. "I didn't say anything. Huyen?" She is completely gone.

A withered yellow rose that is alive in spirit. Whoever touches will hear a voice ask "Would you like a friend?" Acknowledging that voice in anyway will transport them into the spirit realm.

A kitsune is in the living world. To live normally, it abducts people into the spirit realm, transforming into them, and then living their lives out as them.

A young man (Mars "Kit" Kittleman) is asleep in a bed, hooked to wires and tubes. He is in his room, guarded by men who patrol the hallways and outskirts of their nice home. Next to him is an arrangement of yellow roses, one of which is withered. The room in the physical world is luxurious, modern, and large. The grey linen curtains darken the wood slat and marble walls. The room in the spiritual world is a large garden, where he is surrounded by other spirits. He is having tea with them.

A Kitsune has made a deal with other spirits. They won't eat Kit as long as he stays in the spirit realm where they can feast on his spiritual energy. The withered rose is what tethers him to the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, Kit is beloved.

# Investigation
##### At The (Sun's) Zoo, Zoboomafoo
Along Highway 1, beyond the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk, past downtown and the college campuses, tucked and hidden between the preserves, the parks, and the ranches, is a zoo. Sun, what exhibit is everyone currently looking at right now?
- Huyen isn't Huyen. They're actually Kitsune.
- Where Huyen disappeared is a yellow petal.
- Kitsune knows where the house is. Other spirits also know, and can lead you there.

##### The Spirit in the Tree
- The Kitsune is moving towards the hills. Not towards the highway but towards the campus.
	- In fact, so are many other spirits. Not so much like a pilgrimage, but like a friendly outing.
- Someone else passed by, looked a lot like you. Didn't look lost, but headed the same way.
	- I don't know if that's a really good idea. Her spiritual energy isn't as immense as Jin's, but they might just eat her right up.

##### At the House on the Hills
Up towards the base of the school are these nice houses. They're new, they're expensive.
- There are many rooms in this house, but one is guarded more heavily than others.
- There are five guards in the house.
	- Two guards stand outside a room, but every thirty minutes they switch with other guards.
	- Two guards patrol around the house, away from the room.
	- One guard is in a security room, watching the cameras.
- Guards wear suits and earpieces. They are armed.
##### In Kit's Room
Physical: The room is luxurious, modern, and large. The grey linen curtains darken the wood slat and marble walls. Like a picture you'd find in a magazine trying to sell you upscale furniture or a thread of rooms you'd want to live in. A young man in his 20s is asleep in his bed next to his wheelchair, hooked to wires and tubes. A rhythm of beats bounce around the walls. On the other side of the bed away from the monitors is a vase of yellow roses. One of them is withered. There's a closet people can enter.

Spiritual: You enter a large garden. Hedges guide you towards stone steps and trimmed green arches. The sky is blue and the clouds are white. There are yellow roses everywhere. Eventually you stumble upon a gazebo where a young man enjoys a cup of tea with Huyen.

- Spirits are drawn here, like it's a nice park with a water fountain.
- Kit believes he's in a dream that he can't wake up from, like a coma. He enters the scene with *In-a-dream-4*.
- The spirits love Kit, but that's part of the blessing he received. Otherwise, they would just overharvest and kill him right away.
- Kit is tethered to the spirit realm and is an abundant source of spirit essence. If he is returned to the human world, he may not be able to return. It is up to him to leave, which he will the moment he realizes he can (he loses his *dream* status.

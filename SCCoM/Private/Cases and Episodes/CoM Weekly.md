Jerri doing summer classes, for funsies she's taking photography and upper div anthropology
Jerri still working at Motive, probably until she leaves SC
Jerri knows people from anthropology, knows less people in photography

#### Ivy Song
Chatted a bit, sits next to them
Bubbly and very chatty, gossips a lot
Jerri walks over
Will file a police report
#### Lincoln Smith
Bully

Got people to jump Ivy, bullying other people
##### Jackson
##### Frank
#### Katy Perry
Photography professor


Convinced Lincoln to go into forest alone
Lincoln gave Jerri his phone, revealed he ordered Ivy to be jumped
Danny walks in with a basket of mushrooms and herbs and walks away

Danny drops the basket after tripping over a goon running away after
JERRI LIGHTS HERSELF ON FIRE AND THREATENS LINCOLN
Then disappears and teleports next to Danny
Danny sits next to her trampled fungi
Danny asks about Icarus, Jerri looks sad and angry
Jerri asks about the wings. Danny knew about the wings
Jerri tells Danny about Icarus jumping Jerri
Danny asks, is self-immolation in front of Lincoln Jerri trying to vindicate herself about it?

### Downtime
Jerri explores her mythos
	Parses through her old bible, well loved
	To our daughter, love mom and dad
	"What's your relationship with the angel" -> It had to one of us, why not me?
	Lucifer sounds like Jerri's voice and two others
Danny investigates
	Ewen and Icarus knows people "in the mist", the men in black
	Danny has her research material
	Does Jerri know about the men in black?
	Keep Rifts and the Mist hidden, keep themselves hidden
	The mist and the rifts exist because and for each other, what came first?
	There's a way to identify the men in black in media, read between the lines, don't worry about faces but about body languages
	The less real it seems, the greater chance there is to see a man in black
	"Look beyond the mist" -> 
		Intel agent for mafia, espionage, info stealing
		Uncanny intuition
		There're not sure where the mafia went, did they go under? Did they hide?
		It's hard to hard from Danny
		"Why me?" -> "I was always here", "You looked like you needed guidance", "It's not my end of the road"
		"What are you trying to prolong?" -> "This City", "Its people", "The City doesn't what's coming, but maybe we can help"

#Case 
Scenes
A host of spirits, described by Pailey, surround a cursed item. When someone touches it, they hear a faint voice that asks, "Would you like a friend?" If they turn around, they see "something you don't know how to put into words" before their body disappears and the object returns to the podium. They are now in the spirit realm.

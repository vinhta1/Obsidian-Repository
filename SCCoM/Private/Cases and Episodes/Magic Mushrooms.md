# Background
A cold fog kisses the walls of every building and caresses the leaves of every brush. A man sits by his window, watching the black outdoors blend into blue. The condensation of his window matches his glass, empty if not for the ice left behind. When the dawn arrived, the clouds left the forest to laze around with the sun. Light peered through the trees, illuminating the forest floor. This is the moment the Forager was waiting for.

In the few moments of respite between days and nights of early shifts and overtime, Wesson likes to roam about the natural landscapes of Santa Cruz. His breath alternates between frost white and smoke grey.

# Background
In the early morning when the night has died, a cold fog kisses the walls of every building and caresses the leaves of every brush. A man sits by his window, watching the black outdoors blend into blue. The condensation of his window matches his glass, empty if not for the ice left behind. When the dawn arrived, the clouds left the forest to laze around with the sun. Light peered through the trees, illuminating the forest floor. This is the moment the Forager was waiting for.

In the few moments of respite between days and nights of early shifts and overtime, Wesson likes to roam about the natural landscapes of Santa Cruz. His breath alternates between frost white and smoke grey. The high is important; it is essential. If he isn't working, he's thinking about work.

The scene cuts to Wesson sitting in a cubicle. It is one of many, equal if not for the people inside them and the way they have decided to decorate them. A fluorescent white fills the hall, illuminated the grey walls and green carpet walkways. There are no windows: only concrete with chalk and paint landscapes with a clock somewhere for people to watch from time to time. Some employees go their entire shift without looking.

Wesson is antsy. His leg bounces as a sea of keys click-clack through pipelines of spreadsheets, presentations, and design documents. This place is a hive of chittering insects, antennas listening for Slack notifications.

#Case Big Bad Wolf, 3 Pigs, Follow-Up
# Background

The Cleavers and the Hustlers have been at war for as long as the two factions existed. In fact, the Hustlers' existence is a direct response to the extortion and violence from the hands of the Cleavers. Despite this, they don't shy away from extreme measures to fight back. As such, many of the people they protect resent them, often saying that the Hustlers have only made things more difficult and violent for them.

The owner of the Last Straw has submitted damning evidence of the Wolf's crimes. The Axes and his twin brother, RÃ¤v, suggest he goes to jail in his place. Wolf refuses, and then goes to jail and awaits trial and sentencing.

The Hustlers celebrate a small success, before they start being targeted directly by the Cleavers. The Cleavers believe the Hustlers submitted the evidence to the police or at least paid them more than the Cleavers did. The Hustlers mistakenly believe that the Cleavers got Wolf out, so the Hustlers send Ramona to kill him. However, someone is getting to them first and leaving a wake of blood. The results of this case will dictate what happens for the follow up case.

# Investigation
##### At the National 9 motel
- The Cleavers are actively seeking out and attacking Hustlers.
	- Neither the Hustlers or the Cleavers have information about what's going on.
- Hustlers want to know why the Cleavers are attacking them directly.
	- Maybe another Hustler site has more information. (Players choose a motel/hotel, Bay Front Inn Hotel)
- Cleavers want to know who had the dirt on Wolf and turned him in.
	- Involving the police is a huge more and is looked down upon by both sides.
	- But so is targeting each other on their respective home turf.
	- If no answers here, go back to den to recuperate (Players choose a location, El Rio Mobile Home Park is Jules' respective area of control)
##### At the Bay Front Inn Hotel
- Hustler higher-ups ask Ramona to go to an address and kill whoever's inside.
- They don't tell her who it is, but she doesn't ask.
- If pressed, it's the El Rio Mobile Home Park.
	- The higher ups think the Wolf was arrested and is on the loose after escaping capture/being broken out of jail.
	- They're starting to clear out dens in the hope that they find the Wolf, or at least retaliate enough so that they stop attacking Hustler turf.

##### At the El Rio Mobile Home Park
- Everyone in the den is dead or dying.
	- If someone from the Cleavers is there, the Ripper (Izzy) is suspect.
	- An ambush. They broke their phones before they could call for help.

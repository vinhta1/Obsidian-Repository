#Case Big Bad Wolf, 3 Pigs, Follow-Up
# Background

The Cleavers and the Hustlers have been at war for as long as the two factions existed. In fact, the Hustlers' existence is a direct response to the extortion and violence from the hands of the Cleavers. Despite this, they don't shy away from extreme measures to fight back. As such, many of the people they protect resent them, often saying that the Hustlers have only made things more difficult and violent for them.

Ramona is sent on a mission to kill a Cleaver officer known as the Wolf. However, someone is getting to them first. The results of this case will dictate what happens for the follow up case.

The Last Straw has submitted damning evidence of the Wolf's crimes. The Axes and his twin brother, Räv, suggest he goes to jail in his place. Wolf refuses

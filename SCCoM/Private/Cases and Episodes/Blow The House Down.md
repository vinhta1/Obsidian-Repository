#Case Big Bad Wolf, 3 Pigs, Follow-Up
# Background

The Cleavers and the Hustlers have been at war for as long as the two factions existed. In fact, the Hustlers' existence is a direct response to the extortion and violence from the hands of the Cleavers. Despite this, they don't shy away from extreme measures to fight back. As such, many of the people they protect resent them, often saying that the Hustlers have only made things more difficult and violent for them.

The owner of the Last Straw has submitted damning evidence of the Wolf's crimes. The Axes and his twin brother, Räv, suggest he goes to jail in his place. Wolf refuses, and then goes to jail.

The Hustlers celebrate a small success, before they start being targeted directly by the Cleavers. The Cleavers believe the Hustlers submitted the evidence to the police. The MO matches the Wolf, so the Hustlers send Ramona to kill him. However, someone is getting to them first. The results of this case will dictate what happens for the follow up case.

Ramona was sent on a mission to kill a Cleaver officer known as the Wolf. In the attack, she killed his innocent brother, Räv, in the collateral damage.
The Wolf (Ulf) has gone rogue after losing his innocent brother (Räv) in a botched counterattack between the Hustlers and the Cleavers. He is blowing up buildings affiliated to the Hustlers.

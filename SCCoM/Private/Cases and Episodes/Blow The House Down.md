#Case
# Background

The Cleavers and the Hustlers have been at war for as long as the two factions existed. In fact, the Hustlers' existence is a direct response to the extortion and violence from the hands of the Cleavers.
Ramona was sent on a mission to kill a Cleaver officer known as the Wolf. In the attack, she killed his innocent brother, Räv, in the collateral damage.
The Wolf (Ulf) has gone rogue after losing his innocent brother (Räv) in a botched counterattack between the Hustlers and the Cleavers. He is blowing up buildings affiliated to the Hustlers.

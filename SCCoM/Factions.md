# New Chinatown, Gatekeepers
### Goal: Maintain the Mist, Attend to the Ghosts
They've been stretched thin since their founding, about a decade after they lost the Last Chinatown. Established underneath UCSC, they take the time to protect and assist the Mist and the natural order of things. Most rifts operate just fine, since their dealings look like everyday happenings at best. There's enough evil in the world to justify anything nowadays. But when things get a little too weird, they're there to uproot the weeds. Order and ordinary is everything to the Gatekeepers. They don't want a repeat of history. Thus, the Gatekeepers and Avatars have a mutual yet bitter and fragile agreement.

New Chinatown is also the home of the ghosts of their ancestors and relatives. Thus, is it also the Gatekeepers' priority to attend to them and bring hungry ghosts home. There's even a sector in the department dedicated to this task.
### Grey Suits and Old Tradition
Business/business casual to casual/plainclothes attire
When in proper uniform, gatekeepers will usually will stick to grey but sometimes will dress in colors pertaining to the [Wuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_in_Chinese_culture). Of course, the higher up's clothes will match whatever the crowd is wearing, almost changing at a dime. Blink and you'll miss it, stare and you'll forget it.
### DMO: Distract, Mask, Obliviate
If someone saw something they shouldn't have, they didn't. Using their vast intelligence network and methods of divination, Gatekeepers can put agents on the scene before anything happens. These agents follow the DMO motto and take proper precautions to make sure no one realizes something is off, lest they awaken. Their job isn't to stop crime, it's to stop Rifts from waking up others. Thus much to many Gatekeeper's chagrin, if it looks normal enough, it's not their priority.

# Cleaver Gang, Axe Gang from Kung Fu Hustle
### Goal: Make Money, Send a Message
Extort money from businesses and the locals, pay off the cops, recruit members, rinse and repeat. If the threats of violence won't convince someone, the actualization of violence will. Pure brutality speaks loud here. But when people are a little tougher than expected, they'll break legendary martial artists out of prisons or hire pricey assassins.
### Black Suits and Top Hats
Hoodies and black blazers/coats for casual wear, black top hats when in business.
### The Gun's for Looks; the Cleaver's for Business
Most members of this gang stick to any old meat cleaver they can get their hands on, usually holstered to their back and concealed by their coat. However, when they've got their suit on, they sometimes don't bother with hiding their knives. Officers tend to carry a sidearm as well, but will more often send their goons out if they ever need to protect themselves or end someone.

# The Black Company

### Goal: Work. Advance. Profit.
The Black Company isn't one faction. It is more like a conglomerate. A meat grinder that young and aspiring people walk into willingly, only to come out without a will to live. That isn't to say that this company isn't necessary. In fact, it has led to many revolutions in every field: medical advancements, technological breakthroughs, you name it. But behind closed doors and buried underneath paperwork and bureaucracy, things that shouldn't exist are contained in concrete and linoleum cells. Research on Rifts, Relics, and further anomalies are performed in the pursuit of progress, often citing it's "for the good of everyone." Once again, it isn't a faction, or even a singular entity. But if you want to find where all the weird is happening, the headquarters can be found right in the middle of Santa Cruz: a towering pure black monolith that no one can seem to see.
### Dress for Work, and Don't Forget Your Lanyard
Business attire and IDs in plastic covers worn around necks. The IDs belong to some front company most of the time, depending on the branch they work for, and often are employed just to take the fall when the time comes for it despite being highly qualified. You'll see many of them wear Band-Aids behind their ankles.

### Red Tape and Task Forces
If the excessive bureaucracy doesn't stop you, their mobile task forces will. Don't think they're just guys with Kevlar and rifles either, they are built to counter, nullify, and capture if not kill Rifts.

# Cowell Beach
A nice beach by the board walk, hub for beach bums, surfers, and tourists. Everyone here knows Moonshadow, for better or worse.

# Casino Arcade
Just a fun little arcade. So far, nothing special about this place. But it might be a Lotus Tree, and the laser tag zone might be a Labyrinth. Some familiar people here are familiar with Tyler.

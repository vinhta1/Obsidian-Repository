|57|**Scared of Little People.** This NPC somehow is extremely scared of halflings, gnomes and dwarves. He/She could very well be one of those races him/herself, but they’ll only hang around with larger people. Why this NPC feels this way, I’m not sure. Maybe you know?|

|64|**Natural Born Trader.** This NPC tries to sell you everything it can. “See this chair? It’s yours for just two gold pieces! See this flower? Yours for a piece of silver, it’s really rare! See my wife/husband? It’s yours for…”|
|65|**Not a care in the world.** This NPC is unbelievably happy. They only see the good in life and are extremely positive.|

|69|**What’s this for?** This NPC doesn’t use his left arm. He/She just leaves it hanging, doing nothing. There’s nothing wrong with the arm, the NPC just doesn’t use it at all. For nothing.|
|70|**Classic Tammy.** This NPC has underwear visible above his or her pants. It’s not that his/her pants are really low, but his/her underwear is just really high.

|73|**Weirdest Mutton Chops Ever.** This NPC, whether it’s a he or a she doesn’t matter, has the weirdest mutton chops anyone has ever seen. They are a different color than the rest of his/her hair and they are somehow intricately braided.|
|74|**Final Countdown.** This NPC counts down after each conversation. The NPC has a conversation with the party, and when they or the NPC leave, the NPC utters: 73. When the party then asks: “What was that?” The NPC will claim to not know what they are talking about, then leaves again saying: 72. Good luck roleplaying this one.|
|75|**Grumpy face.** This NPC has a face that says: “I hate everything. I hate hating everything.” Basically, his or her face looks incredibly pissed off all the time, even though he or she might be very happy.|

|77|**To be or not to be.** This NPC is desperately trying to become an actor/actress. He/She is not very good at it though. In normal conversations this NPC sounds like he or she is talking on stage, it sounds very fake and extremely articulated.|
|78|**Lip Licker.** This NPC licks his lips, a lot. I mean really, this NPC licks his or her lips constantly. It’s extremely unsettling.|
|79|**Shaving Sucks.** This NPC is very bad at shaving. If it’s a man, he has a lot of small cuts on his face. With a successful DC8 perception or insight check it’s pretty clear that they are the result of terrible shaving. If the NPC is a woman, it is almost the same, but instead the cuts are located on her legs (Yes, even in D&D some women shave their legs. Trust me!).|
|80|**Wild Accuser.** This NPC accuses everyone he talks to of minor crimes, like littering, or making too much noise.|
|81|**Am I hearing this right?** This NPC mishears almost everything. He/She thinks he/she heard everything right, and continues the conversation on whatever subject he/she thinks he/she heard. For example: “Can you tell us where the Inn is?” The NPC hears: “Can you tell us where Theon is?” And responds with: “I have no idea who that is, I’m sorry!” If you still want the NPC to be helpful, make him/her understand every sentence correctly when he/she hears them a second time.|
|82|**Puppet Pal.** This NPC always has a wooden puppet with him/her. Whatever his relationship with this puppet is, is up to you as a DM. Good luck!|
|83|**Bless you!** This NPC has a permanent cold. Always a runny nose and sneezing all the time.|
|84|**Broken down.** This NPC has a broken limb. Roll a d4 to decide which: 1: Their good arm, 2: Their other arm, 3: One leg, 4: Both legs and their good arm.|
|85|**Permanent Ink.** This NPC has a large tattoo of an animal’s head on their neck. If you can’t think of an animal yourself then it’s a chicken’s head.|
|86|**Loading, please wait.** This NPC needs some time processing conversations. Whenever you talk to him/her, it takes them 1d6 + 5 full seconds to respond. Even if it’s a short and simple question.|
|87|**Whispering guide.** This NPC has a small creature hidden in their hair that whispers advice and insight into their ear. The creature is a Sprite, which has the ability to turn invisible and sense if anyone is lying by touching them.|
|88|**My brother, there art thou!** This NPC is convinced that one of the party members is their long lost brother or sister. He or she will not be easily convinced of the contrary.|
|89|**Shapeshifter.** This NPC is actually a doppler. The players might notice subtle changes in the NPC’s physical attributes each subsequent visit, like a smaller nose, another eye colour or an extra feet in height.|
|90|**Lilac and Gooseberries.** This NPC smells like lilac and gooseberries, a particular smell that might be familiar to some of the players.|
|91|**Mouthful.** This NPC always has something in his/her mouth. It could be food… but they never swallow. And it's too big to be chewing gum. It makes this NPC very hard to understand.|
|92|**The Narrator.** This NPC always speaks about him or herself in the third person, and he or she narrates everything that happens in their vicinity.|
|93|**Narcissist.** This NPC is always holding a mirror, looking at him or herself while blowing kisses and winking. It looks away now and then to look at the party but he or she mostly looks at themselves.|
|94|**Needlessly Shifty.** This NPC comes across as very shifty. He or she laughs sneakily after answering questions or making deals, like he or she is hiding something. But they aren't, it's just a weird mannerism they were born with.|
|95|**Fungal infection.** This NPC has a small growth of blue green fungus on one of their cheeks. Under close scrutiny the fungus almost seems to pulsate with every heartbeat.|
|96|**Squinter.** This NPC squints their eyes at the party. It looks like he/she needs a pair of glasses.|
|97|**Mad hatter.** This NPC wears a really long, really silly pointy hat. It's over 3 feet (1 meter) tall, made up of different kinds of materials and colors. Possible explanation for why the NPC is wearing it: 1. Their kid made it for them and now they are pretty much obligated to wear it. 2. They made it themselves because they believe it will make them a really powerful wizard. 3. It is a cursed hat that can't be removed and someone put it on their head while they were sleeping.|
|98|**Sketch artist.** This NPC is scribbling on a piece of paper while he or she is talking to the party. After a while they proudly show the sketch they made of one of the party members. Roll 1d6/2 to see how good this NPC is. 1: Very, very bad. 2: Extremely average. 3: Very, very good.|
|99|**Want a cookie?** This NPC bakes their own cookies and offers to anyone and everyone to try. Roll 1d6/2 to determine the quality. 1: Terrible, bitter and is that a hair? 2: Average, OK cookies. 3: These are amazing, crunchy, sweet and something you can't quite put your finger on but it's awesome.|
|100|**Juggler.** This NPC is an excellent juggler and will juggle everytime he or she has two or more items in his or her hands. Their limit is 1d6 + 3 items at once.||

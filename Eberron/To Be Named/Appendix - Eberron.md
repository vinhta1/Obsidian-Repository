# Sharn, City of Towers
[5e.tools - Ch. 3: Sharn, City of Towers](https://5e.tools/book.html#erlw,8)
## Aftermath of War
Far from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.
- Physical Damage
	- On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside Sharn.
	- In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.
- Psychological Scars
	- There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations.
	- These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations.
- Shortages
	- Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.
- Refugees and Victims
	- Sharn is home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.

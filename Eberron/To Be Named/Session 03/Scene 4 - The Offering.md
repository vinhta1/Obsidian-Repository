***The Ritual.*** Ebian is trying to complete the ritual sacrifice before the characters can save Oliver's daughter. Oliver's daughter is at 0 hit points and is stable (does not require death saves). To complete the ritual Ebian must continue chanting and concentrating for 3 rounds. If he is distracted or takes damage, he needs to roll a successful Constitution saving throw as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, the ritual stops! However, he angrily joins combat at that point.
If Ebian completes the ritual without the characters stopping him, he plunges the dagger into Oliver's daughter’s chest, killing her instantly. A wave of dark energy bursts from the altar and hangs over the entire mansion. All characters receive disadvantage on ability checks and attacks while inside the mansion.

***The Combatants.***
- **Ebian.** Ebian attempts the ritual until it is complete or disrupted. They fight until half health. After which, he will attempt to run out of the mansion and out of the extradimensional space.
- **Noram.** Noram will fight the party as long as Ebian is there or until half health. After Ebian leaves, they will start attacking the other cultists. At this point, it may be revealed that Noram is a House Medani spy, looking into the cults. At half health, they can turn against the cult or try to run away.
- **Flayo.** Flayo fights to the death.
- **Cultists.** Two other cultists fight to the death.


Underneath Oliver’s daughter is a book from his study. In the book, a letter “To Oliver Catena”:
“Only a dragonmark can save your daughter now.”

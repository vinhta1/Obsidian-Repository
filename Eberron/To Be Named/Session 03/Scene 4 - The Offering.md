> [!quote] The Theater
> The inside of the theatre is spacious, especially without a crowd inside at the moment. The area is 100 feet wide and 95 feet from the lobby doors to the edge of the stage. One wide aisle runs down the middle of the room, and two narrow ones along each wall. The audience chairs are affixed to the floor, row upon row. There are two chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, one about 30 feet above the stage, the other about 10 feet above the lobby entrance.
> On stage is an altar, with a girl tied to it. Standing behind her, a figure in a glamerweave cloak holds a dagger above her body. The acoustics of the theatre carry the sound of repetitive chanting that is slowly increasing in intensity!

To set the stage, roll a d6 twice and 
|d6|Stage Conditions|
|---|---|
|1|**Dim Lighting.** Many of the everbright lanterns in the Silvermist are missing or failed. There are large stretches of dim illumination.|
|2|**Crumbling Infrastructure.** If someone swings on the chandelier, it will probably come down. Curtains could fall. You could even set a space on the stage that is secretly ready to collapse — a trapdoor that has finally had too much, dropping a character ten feet into a storage pit.
|3|**Stage weaponry.** There’s a vast array of armor and weaponry. It’s all for show — the armor offers half the usual protection and the weapons inflict half damage — but it could be useful for color.|
|4|**Trampolines.** The Theater has a few bouncing mats. Anyone who stands on one of these mats can trigger the effect of the jump spell as a free action that lasts one turn.|
|5|**Explosions!** The Korranor has a variety of illusionary pyrotechnic effects. These could be controlled from a conductor’s podium… or they could be randomly triggered by character action. Any time someone is reduced to 0 hit points, it triggers a mournful tune!|
|6|**Illusion.** Every surface of the stage can be infused with illusion. The stage could suddenly appear to be on fire, or be transformed into a battlefield scene or a perilous arrangement of pits. Are the player characters willing to walk through the flames?|

***The Combatants.***
There are two cultists armed with hand crossbows and scimitars, along with Ebian, Flayo, and Noram, inside the theatre.
- **Ebian.** Ebian attempts the ritual until it is complete or disrupted. They fight until half health. After which, he will attempt to run out of the mansion and out of the extradimensional space.
- **Noram.** Noram will fight the party as long as Ebian is there or until half health. After Ebian leaves, they will start attacking the other cultists. At this point, it may be revealed that Noram is a House Medani spy, looking into the cults. At half health, they can turn against the cult or try to run away.
They use the stage, curtains, and seats for half cover until they engage in melee, but are otherwise not coordinated in their tactics.

***The Ritual.*** Ebian is trying to complete the ritual sacrifice before the characters can save Oliver's daughter. Oliver's daughter is at 0 hit points and is stable (does not require death saves). To complete the ritual Ebian must continue chanting and concentrating for 3 rounds. If he is distracted or takes damage, he needs to roll a successful Constitution saving throw as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, the ritual stops! However, he angrily joins combat at that point.
If Ebian completes the ritual without the characters stopping him, he plunges the dagger into Oliver's daughter’s chest, killing her instantly. A wave of dark energy bursts from the altar and hangs over the entire mansion. All characters receive disadvantage on ability checks and attacks while inside the mansion.

***Chandeliers.*** Rejoice! There are two chandeliers in the theatre, one above the entrance from the lobby and one directly above the stage. A character that climbs up 10 feet to the entrance chandelier and succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check can swing right up to the stage with their movement! The first character to swing successfully gains advantage on their next attack on their turn. A failed check means they still swing to the stage, but land prone and are incapacitated until the beginning of their next turn. Only one character may use the chandelier per round.





Next to Oliver’s daughter is a book from his study. In the book, a letter “To Oliver Catena”:
“Only a dragonmark can save your daughter now.”

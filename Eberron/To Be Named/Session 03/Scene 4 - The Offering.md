> [!quote] The Theater
> The inside of the theatre is spacious, especially without a crowd inside at the moment. The area is 100 feet wide and 95 feet from the lobby doors to the edge of the stage. One wide aisle runs down the middle of the room, and two narrow ones along each wall. The audience chairs are affixed to the floor, row upon row. There are two chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, one about 30 feet above the stage, the other about 10 feet above the lobby entrance.
> On stage is an altar, with a girl tied to it. Standing behind her, a figure in a glamerweave cloak holds a dagger above her body. The acoustics of the theatre carry the sound of repetitive chanting that is slowly increasing in intensity!

***The Combatants.***
There are two cultists armed with hand crossbows and scimitars, along with Ebian, Flayo, and Noram, inside the theatre.
- **Ebian.** Ebian attempts the ritual until it is complete or disrupted. They fight until half health. After which, he will attempt to run out of the mansion and out of the extradimensional space.
- **Noram.** Noram will fight the party as long as Ebian is there or until half health. After Ebian leaves, they will start attacking the other cultists. At this point, it may be revealed that Noram is a House Medani spy, looking into the cults. At half health, they can turn against the cult or try to run away.
They use the stage, curtains, and seats for half cover until they engage in melee, but are otherwise not coordinated in their tactics.

***The Ritual.*** Ebian is trying to complete the ritual sacrifice before the characters can save Oliver's daughter. Oliver's daughter is at 0 hit points and is stable (does not require death saves). To complete the ritual Ebian must continue chanting and concentrating for 3 rounds. If he is distracted or takes damage, he needs to roll a successful Constitution saving throw as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, the ritual stops! However, he angrily joins combat at that point.
If Ebian completes the ritual without the characters stopping him, he plunges the dagger into Oliver's daughter’s chest, killing her instantly. A wave of dark energy bursts from the altar and hangs over the entire mansion. All characters receive disadvantage on ability checks and attacks while inside the mansion.

***Chandeliers.*** Rejoice! There are two chandeliers in the theatre,
one above the entrance from the lobby and one directly above
the stage. A character that climbs up 10 feet to the entrance
chandelier and succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
can swing right up to the stage with their movement! The first
character to swing successfully gains advantage on their next
attack on their turn. A failed check means they still swing to the
stage, but land prone and are incapacitated until the beginning
of their next turn. Only one character may use the chandelier per
round.




Next to Oliver’s daughter is a book from his study. In the book, a letter “To Oliver Catena”:
“Only a dragonmark can save your daughter now.”

***The Ritual.*** Ebian is trying to complete the ritual sacrifice before the characters can save Oliver's daughter. Oliver's daughter is at 0 hit points and is stable (does not require death saves). To complete the ritual Ebian must continue chanting and concentrating for 3 rounds. If he is distracted or takes damage, he needs to roll a successful Constitution saving throw as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, the ritual stops! However, he angrily joins combat at that point, fighting until half health.
If Ebian completes the ritual without the characters stopping him, he plunges the dagger into Oliver's daughterâ€™s chest, killing her instantly. A wave of dark energy bursts from the altar and hangs over the entire mansion. All characters receive disadvantage on ability checks and attacks while inside the mansion.

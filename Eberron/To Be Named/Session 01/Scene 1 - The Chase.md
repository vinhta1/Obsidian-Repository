> It's a beautiful day in Sharn, and the city is still hustling and bustling despite the war on the eastern borders of Breland. It is the 934th Year of the Kingdom (YK), and no one knows when the war will end, if it ever does end. But, that's not what is important to you right now.
# The Rooftops (University District / Platinate)
- [ ] *The party has the Man in the Glamerweave as a person of interest.*

> [!info] Ebian's Objective
>Ebian is going to try to lead the players to the **Dezina Museum of Antiquities** where Oliver works.

***Stalking the Target.*** When stalking a target, each participant must try to hide from each other and make perception checks for each other at the end of each round. Ebian has a Passive Perception of 12 and rolls Stealth (+2). Once a player fails their first stealth check, Ebian is alert and will start rolling Perception (+2) checks to actively look for the stalkers. If the players fail their second stealth check, Ebian will start running and a chase will begin. Otherwise, after 5 rounds Ebian will walk into the **Dezina Museum of Antiquities**, where he cannot escape. The stalk follows the predetermined sequence below:
- **Round 1.** A crowd blocks your way. Make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (your choice) to make your way through the crowd unimpeded. On a failed check, you and your target gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- **Round 2.** Ebian turns a corner into a maze of alleyways, crates, barrels, and gates. Make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Intelligence check (your choice) to navigate the maze. On a failed check, you gain disadvantage on your next Dexterity (Stealth) or Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Round 3.** No complication.
- **Round 4.** There is a long bridge. You get advantage on your next Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Round 5.** Ebian stops and turns around. Ebian gets advantage on their next Wisdom (Perception) check.

If players fail a Wisdom (Perception) check twice in a row, they can either lose Ebian or force a chase.

***Running the Chase***. The chase starts with Ebian either 50 or 80 feet ahead of the lead pursuer, depending on how the session starts and the characters. Roll initiative to determine order for the characters and assume Ebian goes on initiative count 15. The chase ends if at the end of the round, the distance between the lead pursuer and Ebian is 0 feet, or after 5 rounds when Ebian dashes into the Dezina Museum of Antiquities. During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion.

# Dezina Museum of Antiquities (University District)
*TRUE*

"Attached to Morgrave University, this building displays the relics recovered on the university's many expeditions."

>[!info]  Ebian's Objective
>Ebian has two goals:
>- Destroy some of the Draconic display cases, including the one that holds the ritual dagger.
>- Get Oliver's attention so that he interacts with the party.
>
>After which, he will surrender.

> [!warning] State Change
>  
> *IF The party is associated with any of the houses.*
> *OR The Man in the Glamerweave is associated with any of the houses.*
> - [ ] Ebian is placed into the House Medani Incarceration Facility.
>
> *ELSE*
> - [ ] Ebian is placed into the Warden Towers Jail.

After Ebian is restrained, Oliver can interact with the adventurers. They will also offer to house the adventurer's for a night if they want.
# Oliver’s Home (Ivy Towers)
- [ ] *The party has helped Oliver in the past.*


They meet Alana, his wife, and Valera, their daughter.
Valera is 5 years old. Oliver and Alana are 29 and 31, together for 9 years so far.
The food is delicious: good ‘ol sopas, thrice poached eggs, sizzling pheasant.
Their last names are Catena if the players ask.
Players sleep in the guest room, 4 bunk beds, wardrobes, etc.


> [!info]
>They can visit the study if they want.
> - Oliver is studying the draconic language, and Alana is studying dragonmarks.
> 	- Many wizards and artificers understand draconic, very few actually speak it. Reading and writing is much harder. It’s like a heritage language.
> - They both attend Morgrave University, and frequently visit the library’s basement where they house more exotic material like the draconic language and history.

The next morning, Oliver and Alana wish them well and hope for a fast processing for the Man in the Glamerweave.

Players are then encouraged to explore Sharn for a day or two.

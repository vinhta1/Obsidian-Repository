# Outside Oliver's Home (Ivy Towers)
*TRUE*

The characters need to get inside Oliver's home to look for clues, however, they need to get past the watchman (human guard) first. The characters can try any of the approaches listed below or any other as approved by the Dungeon Master, but if they fail, they cannot attempt the same one again.
- ***Persuasion***. The Sharn Watch is known to be riddled with corruption. That works to the characters’ advantage if they offer the watchman some coin to let them in. If the characters offer the watchman at least 1 gp and they succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, they convince the watchman to look the other way. Offering 5 gp gives them advantage on the roll, while 10 gp gets them in without the check (automatic success).
- ***Stealth***. The watchman has been standing guard all night and he is tired. A successful DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) group check allows the characters to sneak past him. Any reasonable distraction will give the characters advantage. If more than half the characters succeed, they are able to enter undetected. If more than half the characters fail, the watchman returns or notices them before they are able to get inside.
- ***Deception***. (This approach cannot be used if any of the others failed beforehand.) The characters can pretend to be Inquisitives or otherwise bluff their way past the watchman with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. However, if they are able to present forged papers or identification, they can get in without a check.
- ***Intimidation***. The watchman is steeled against threats and a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check is required to make the watchman bow to the characters will. If the characters fail to intimidate the watchman, they make any other checks in the scene with disadvantage as the watchman becomes angry and alert.
- ***Violence***. Attacking the Sharn Watch is a very bad idea and is categorized under the most serious transgression of the law. Warn the characters before they do this!

# The Nearby Alley (Oliver's Home)
- [ ] *The party failed to get past the guard.*
- [ ] *OR The party checks the nearby vicinity.*

Raphael the beggar witnessed the kidnappers after they exited Oliver's home and overheard some of their conversation. If the characters approach him, he is hesitant to speak with them at first, but opens up with a DC 9 Charisma (Persuasion) check or a small token (1 sp) of trust.

> [!quote] Dialogue
> “Two nights ago? Yeah, I remember. Three of them came through, a couple of them wearing those fancy theatre masks. They was carrying a sleeping child. I figured they were heading to a theater to perform.
> Performers can make a sweet sovereign (sp). I followed them a bit, none the wiser, as they went straight for the lifts. Maybe have a chance to pocket something of value as they hurried along. But they weren't going for the lifts at all. They walked past the watch, and I wasn't trying to get "escorted" down, so I watched them go from the shadows. Returned to my spot later on, none the wiser.”

> [!faq] Clues
> - Ebian is supposed to meet up with them tonight.
> - "Will they find us?" "Unless The Watch reads Draconic for fun, I doubt it."
> - "Should we go to the Jail/House Medani? What if something goes wrong?" "No, have faith. We need to prepare the child."
> - *If Oliver is with the party:* He tosses a token to Raphael, and he drops the act. "The Clan owes you a favor, Ollie?"
> 	- The cultists were heading towards the University District.
> 	- If you need more clues, look for a half-elf inquisitive named Alfan. He's watching the Jail/House Medani Incarceration Facility from southwest adjacent building. Two knocks, however many people are with you, then three knocks.
# Dezina Museum of Antiquities (University District)
*TRUE*

> [!faq] Clues
> - *If the display cases were knocked over:*
> 	- DC 13 Investigation (Int) or Perception (Wis)
> 		- A display case that should be broken, isn’t. It contained a obsidian dagger with a black Khyber dragonshard embedded in the hilt worth 150 gp. The dagger currently in the display is a fake.

Oliver wants to go check up with Alana and comfort her. Players can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Oliver to follow them and see this through.

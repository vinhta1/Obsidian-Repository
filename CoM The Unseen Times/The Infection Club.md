#Factions
The Infection Club has gotten a bad rep throughout [[Lower East Side Preparatory High School, Lower East Side|Lower East Side Prep]], known for being "a bunch of emos" that probably go around to scare the elderly or are always trying to give the other students a hard time.

# The Initiation Ritual
Any infected individual can pass on Vector's DNA through their own. Any way a germ can be spread, Vector's infection can be spread. They do this through a party/hangout with food. There is always some sort of dip. These parties tend to take place at the [[Domino Sugar Refinery, Williamsburg|abandoned sugar refinery]]
across the East River.

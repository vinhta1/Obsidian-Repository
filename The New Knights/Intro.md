A blight has fallen upon Camelot. King Arthur is dead, Excalibur has shattered, the Round Table has split, and magic has abandoned us. Evil forces of nature seek to consume what remains of the kingdom. Yet chivalry dictates that someone will rise, that someone *must* rise to protect the people of Britain. O knight, will you be our salvation?

You once resided on the outskirts of Wales. You are no king. You are no wizard. You are no knight. You have no status. You may even have no honor. And yet, something calls you to Camelot. Instead of fleeing deeper into Europe, you contemplate marching towards the twisted, overgrown tower. You are not alone in these thoughts. And thus I beg you, fear not and steel your resolve. Rally with the few others like you. Watch your brothers-and-sisters-in-arms, and may they watch you. March, towards the screams and ruin of death. March, towards the green, evil, and arcane. March, towards deliverance and destiny.
